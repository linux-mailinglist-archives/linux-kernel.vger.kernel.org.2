     you meant "each one is used per supported compression"?

It allocates each own zcomp, not sharing even though zram devices
use the same compression algorithm.

It's very helpful to understand. Thanks a lot!S

So IIUC, it's fundamentally race between destroy_devices(i.e., module
unload) and every sysfs knobs in zram. Isn't it?
Below specific example is one of them and every sysfs code in zram
could access freed object(e.g., zram->something).
And you are claiming there isn't good way to fix it in kernfs(please
add it in the description, too) even though it's general problem.
(If we had, we may detect the race and make zram_remove_cb fails
so unloading modulies fails, finally)

So, shouldn't we introcude a global rw_semaphore?

destroy_devices
  class_unregister
  down_write(&zram_unload);
  idr_for_each(zram_remove_cb);
  up_write(&zram_unload);

And every sysfs code hold the lock with down_read in the first place
and release the lock right before return. So, introduce a zram sysfs
wrapper to centralize all of locking logic.

Does it make sense?

				  I think sysfs was already remove here.

So,

	CPU 1                            CPU 2
 
destroy_devices
..
				 disksize_store()
				   zcomp_create
				   zcomp_init
idr_for_each(zram_remove_cb
  zram_remove
  zram_reset
  zcomp_destroy
  cpuhp_state_remove_instance
				   cpuhp_state_add_instance
..

cpuhp_remove_multi_state(...)
  Detect!
    kernel: Error: Removing state 63 which has instances left.

Yub, It's much better. Let's have it in the commit log.

Thanks.
