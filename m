Which BUG_ON is that please? I don't see any relevant one near that line in
current upstream kernel...

Thanks for the analysis and the patch but the fact is that the extent tree
is going to be corrupted one way or the other. And I think other disk
corruptions can lead to similar problematic extent layout anyway. So I
rather think we need to make the code more robust to not take the kernel
down when seeing corrupted extent tree - and we've done work to make code
more robust in this sence in the past. Can you reproduce the issue with the
current upstream kernel? If yes, we are probably still missing extent tree
consistency checks on some path and we need to add them...
