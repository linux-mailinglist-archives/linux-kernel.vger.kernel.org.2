Well this all depends on when the the soft limit reclaim triggeres. In
other words how often you see the global memory reclaim. If we have a
memcg with a sufficient excess then this will work mostly fine. I was more
worried about a case when you have memcgs just slightly over the limit
and the global memory pressure is a regular event. You can easily end up
bouncing memcgs off and on the tree in a rapid fashion.

Yes, I agree this is more of a workaround than a fix but I would rather
go and touch the threshold which is simply bad than play more tricks
which can lead to other potential problems. All that for a feature which
is rarely used and quite problematic in itself. Not sure what Johannes
thinks about that.
