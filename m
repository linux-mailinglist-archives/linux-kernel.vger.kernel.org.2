First frame of the splash means that something is "a bit" wrong...
...like the DSI clock is a little off.

I don't have such hardware, otherwise I would've tried... but what you
describe is a bit strange.
Is there any other older qcom platform using this chip? Any other
non-qcom platform? Is the driver for the SN65DSI86 surely fine?
Anyway, as you know, I would never propose untested patches nor
partially working ones for any reason: I'm sorry that this happened.

In any case, just to be perfectly transparent, while being here waiting
for review, this patch series got tested on more smartphones, even ones
that I don't personally own, with different displays.

For your reference, here's a list (all MSM8998..):
- OnePlus 5               (1920x1080)
- F(x)Tec Pro 1           (2160x1080)
- Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact (1280x720)
- Sony Xperia XZ1         (1920x1080)
- Sony Xperia XZ Premium  (3840x2160)

So much "fun". This makes me think something about the PCC block doing
the wrong thing (getting misconfigured).

 From a fast read, the SN65DSI86 is on I2C.. giving it a wrong dsi clock
cannot produce (logically, at least) this, so I say that it is very
unlikely for this to be a consequence of the 10nm pll fixes...

...unless the bootloader is not configuring the DSI rates, but that's
also veeeeery unlikely (it always does, or it always does not).

I would be happy if someone from Qualcomm takes a look: after all, there
is no documentation and they're the only ones that can verify this kind
of stuff. Please, Qualcomm.

Besides that, if there's anything I can help with to solve this riddle,
I'm here for you.

Yours,
