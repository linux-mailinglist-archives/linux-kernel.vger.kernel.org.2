Sure, I'm ok with changing the name (assuming that the second lock is kept).

pmic_arb->lock is currently used tightly around the code in the SPMI bus 
callback functions which write to SPMI PMIC arbiter registers to trigger 
an SPMI transaction, poll in a loop to wait for completion, and read any 
command results.  Each of these uses correspond to a command defined in 
the MIPI SPMI spec.  There is no read-modify-write command in the spec.

Thus, implementing qpnpint_spmi_set_bit/clear_bit() functions would 
require an approach like one of these:

1. Removing the locking from pmic_arb_read_cmd() and pmic_arb_write_cmd(), 
defining new wrapper functions around them to just contain the locking, 
and adding a read-modify-write wrapper function that locks and calls both 
pmic_arb_read_cmd() and pmic_arb_write_cmd().

2. Or, create a new function that duplicates the contents of both 
pmic_arb_read_cmd() and pmic_arb_write_cmd(), allowing it to issue two 
SPMI bus commands with pmic_arb->lock held.

Option #1 seems like it would result in less clear and messy code than is 
currently present.  It would also have a minor performance impact during 
simultaneous SPMI requests due to non-contentious checks, address look-ups 
and command formatting unnecessarily waiting for lock acquisition.

Option #2 would likely be less messy than option #1; however, it results 
in duplication of low-level code which is undesirable.

I prefer the approach used in this patch as it doesn't disrupt the 
architecture of the SPMI bus and PMIC IRQ functions.  However, I'm willing 
to switch to your suggestion if you think it is a better design and 
cleaner/clearer solution.  Please let me know your thoughts.  Would you 
want option #1, #2, or something else?
