Right, in fact every email I see from @cortina-access.com at
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/?q=cortina-access.com is a reply, but the
original mails are all missing, not just this series.

It appears that there is a problem between the mail servers of cortina-access
and kernel.org. Alex and Jason, please double-check if you find
anything in

https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/email-clients.html

that may have caused this on your end, or otherwise contact
postmaster@vger.kernel.org for help.

Ah right. That patch has not made it in because of the issue, but right
away I can tell that the binding is not great because the compatible
string is way too generic: it implies that cortina-access only uses a single
serial port type in every past, present or future SoC, which is clearly
not the case.

It's obviously up to Greg to decide whether to revert the patch, but
I'd suggest we don't treat the driver as conforming to the binding until
it has been reviewed, and assume that changes will be made.

Assuming this is a SoC based on an Arm CPU core, it's clear that
nothing from cortina-access.com ever made it through the
linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org mailing list either, if anything
was sent at all.

Alex, please try to contact me off-list about merging the full SoC
support, I should be able to help you come up with a plan for
submitting the rest as soon as the email troubles are resolved.

For new Arm based SoC platforms, arch/{arm,arm64} patches
should go through the soc tree and be picked up by Olof (on Cc)
or me. The exact process is not well documented, but please
contact us by email, or on irc://irc.libera.chat/#armlinux if you
have questions.

       Arnd
