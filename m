I don't know the details of this, and I need some time to investigate it.

I doubt that fatal signal should block any vmalloc allocations.
I assume there are situations where rollback of some cancelled operation uses vmalloc.
Or coredump saving on some remote storage can uses vmalloc.

However for me it's abnormal that even OOM-killer cannot cancel huge vmalloc allocation.
So I think tsk_is_oom_victim(current) check should be added to vm_area_alloc_pages() 
to break vmalloc cycle.

Thank you,
