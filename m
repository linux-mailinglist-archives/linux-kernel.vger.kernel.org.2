Subject: [PATCH 5/8] crypto: api - always set CRYPTO_ALG_TESTED in lookup larvals' ->mask/type
Date:   Sun,  3 Oct 2021 20:14:10 +0200

For crypto_alg_lookup(), the input parameter combination of mask and type
where both have CRYPTO_ALG_TESTED unset is special in that it is supposed
to be handled as if said flag had been set in both for convenience.

However, the code in crypto_alg_lookup() is not equivalent between these
two cases:
- If CRYPTO_ALG_TESTED is unset in both type and mask, a pending
  lookup larval with or without ->CRYPTO_ALG_TESTED being set in its
  ->mask and ->type can potentially get returned, whereas if
  CRYPTO_ALG_TESTED is set in both, only the former is possible.
- If CRYPTO_ALG_TESTED is unset in both type and mask, an error would get
  returned if there was one or more matching algorithms which all had
  failed their selftests. If OTOH CRYPTO_ALG_TESTED had been set in both
  type and mask, NULL would get returned in this case of universal failure
  and the caller would proceed to re-request the algorithm in question,
  which is not desired.

Even though the first issue is only a cosmetic one and does not affect
functionality in any way AFAICT, addressing it with this patch here will
improve consistency and allow for streamlining crypto_alg_lookup() a bit
later in this series. The second item in the list from above will be left
to a later patch.

Remember that crypto_larval_lookup() will only invoke crypto_larval_add()
if CRYPTO_ALG_TESTED has been set in either none or both of mask and type.
Make crypto_larval_lookup() always set CRYPTO_ALG_TESTED for the mask
and type values passed to crypto_larval_add(). That is, the "issue"
described above is being addressed by sticking to a canonical lookup larval
representation for the two equivalent cases.

There is no change in functionality.
