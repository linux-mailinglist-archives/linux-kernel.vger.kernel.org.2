Dear friend.
I assume you and your family are in good health. I am the Foreign
operations Manager at one of the leading generation bank here in West
Africa.

This being a wide world in which it can be difficult to make new
acquaintances and because it is virtually impossible to know who is
trustworthy and who can be believed, i have decided to repose
confidence in you after much fasting and prayer. It is only because of
this that I have decided to confide in you and to share with you this
confidential business.

In my bank; there resides an overdue and unclaimed sum of $15.5m,
(Fifteen Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars Only) When the account
holder suddenly passed on, he left no beneficiary who would be
entitled to the receipt of this fund. For this reason, I have found it
expedient to transfer this fund to a trustworthy individual with
capacity to act as foreign business partner. Thus i humbly request
your assistance to claim this fund.
Upon the transfer of this fund in your account, you will take 45% as
your share from the total fund, 10% will be shared to Charity
Organizations in both country and 45% will be for me. Please if you
are really sure you can handle this project, contact me immediately.
Yours Faithful,
Mr. Alison Andrew
