Yes, this is for the events which is defined with fixed-size
parameters and what I suggested.

Yes, this is for the events, which is defined with variable length
parameters, like null-terminated string. In this case, along with the
__data/__rel_loc validation, it needs a null termination check.

I would rather like that the filters will be available on the user_events.

My question is that you need to log the dynamic data or strings via user-
events or not. Since the other user-events, like SDT doesn't support the
string variables to trace, I guess that is not a high priority.

Moreover, since now we can use eprobes, if user event records the address of
user-string, the eprobes can fetch it.

So, my suggestion is implmenting with fixed-size parameters as the first step
and keep filter/histograms/eprobes available on the user-events.
If you find any performance issue, you can expand the user-events to support
dynamic (array) data and strings.

Because all data is written from the kernel code. We can trust the data
exists on the buffer. (If not, there is an actual BUG in the kenrel)
We can add a verifieer for the debug purpose.

Of course, and that must be fixed. And, the tracepoints (traceevents) should
be automatically generated code, that is more trusted than the events crafted
by user.
