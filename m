Dear RT folks!

I'm pleased to announce the v5.14-rt17 patch set. 

Changes since v5.14-rt16:

  - Teach lockdep to recognize read-locks on configurations without QRW
    locks.

  - Various futex patches addressing fallout reported by syzbot caused
    by the locking rework. Patches by Thomas Gleixner.

Known issues
     - netconsole triggers WARN.

     - The "Memory controller" (CONFIG_MEMCG) has been disabled.

     - A RCU and ARM64 warning has been fixed by Valentin Schneider. It is
       still not clear if the RCU related change is correct.

     - Clark Williams reported issues in i915 (execlists_dequeue_irq())

     - Valentin Schneider reported a few splats on ARM64, see
          https://https://lkml.kernel.org/r/.kernel.org/lkml/20210810134127.1394269-1-valentin.schneider@arm.com/

The delta patch against v5.14-rt16 is appended below and can be found here:
 
     https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/5.14/incr/patch-5.14-rt16-rt17.patch.xz

You can get this release via the git tree at:

    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rt/linux-rt-devel.git v5.14-rt17

The RT patch against v5.14 can be found here:
