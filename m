This sounds good to me.

These will not be the same ID. The data_id will be the offset within a
page to check for status. We don't want to give user mode processes
access to the entire tracefs, so we are isolating to a few files that
will get wider access.

Agree with the above, cool idea.

We still require the ioctl to register and cannot bet solely on
dynamic_events. We want a fast way to register events on process startup
and get the data_id back as fast as possible.

The other thing is we need ref counting to know if the event is busy.
Having the ID in the packet avoids having a fd per-event, but it also
makes ref counting process lifetime of each event quite hard.

We want to avoid the kernel component touching any of the user data. For
example eBPF programs will parse the data directly from definitions
provided by the user. If the kernel side changed what the user expected
from their side the eBPF program would fail to decode. We also want
predicate filtering to work as cheap as possible. I would really like to
keep offset manipulation entirely in the user space to avoid confusion
across the various tracing mechanisms and avoid probing the user data
upon each call (eBPF programs only selectively probe in data).

I have a few colleagues testing some ideas out about this. Should I have
them reach out to you for ideas or collaboration?
