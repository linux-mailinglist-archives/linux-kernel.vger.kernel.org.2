Yes indeed, but my concern is also not to introduce to much contention
on the RX path (with irqsave spinlocking & friends), given that this racy
scenario has surely to be handled but it is also highly unlikely, so I don't
want to slow down all the rx path all the time.

So I tried something along this lines:

Can you give it a go on your setup ?

Beware it is not really tested on the racy error path (:P) and I could have
still missed something regarding synchro (and I expect an undesired refcount
warn on the scmi_release_channel too when the race is hit....but just to
experiment a bit for now and see if something like this could be enough while
avoiding further locking)

Thanks,
Cristian
