Hi Leo,

Would you be ok with the current patch the way it is? In case it's of
any help, I'm sharing the testing steps that James and I went through
when testing this internally, if you want to add to it

- Test that only a portion of the buffer is saved until there is a wraparound

$ ./perf record -vvv -e arm_spe/period=148576/u -S -- taskset --cpu-list 0 stress --cpu 1 & while true; do sleep 0.2; killall -s USR2 perf; done

- Test snapshot mode in CPU mode

$ sudo ./perf record -vvv -C 0 -e arm_spe/period=148576/u -S -- taskset --cpu-list 0 stress --cpu 1 &

- Test that auxtrace buffers correspond to an aux record
- Test snapshot default sizes in sudo and user modes
- Test small snapshot size

$ ./perf record -vvv -e arm_spe/period=148576/u -S1000 -m16,16 -- taskset --cpu-list 0 stress --cpu 1 &

If there are any concerns with the patches, please let me know and I
will try to address them.

Thanks,
German
