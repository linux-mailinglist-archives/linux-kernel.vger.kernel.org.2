I've just hit the same lockdep complaint. When looking at this another
option to solve this complaint seemed to be to modify bfq_bio_merge() like:

        ret = blk_mq_sched_try_merge(q, bio, nr_segs, &free);
 
+       spin_unlock_irq(&bfqd->lock);
        if (free)
                blk_mq_free_request(free);
-       spin_unlock_irq(&bfqd->lock);

        return ret;

to release request outside of bfqd->lock. Because AFAICT there's no good
reason why we are actually freeing the request under bfqd->lock. And it
would seem a bit safer than annotating-away the lockdep complaint (as much
as I don't see a problem with your analysis). Paolo?
