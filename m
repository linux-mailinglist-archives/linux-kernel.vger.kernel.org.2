live patching removes modules?  We have so many code paths that are
"best effort" when it comes to module unloading, trying to resolve this
one is a valiant try, but not realistic.

What other drivers have this problem?

LTP and fuzzing too do not remove modules.  So I do not understand the
root problem here, that's just something that does not happen on a real
system.
