It appears that the story behind the issue is long enough.
I'll try to sum up the things:
[1] 09954bad4487 floppy: refactor open() flags handling
[2] ff06db1efb2a floppy: fix open(O_ACCMODE) for ioctl-only open
[3] 468c298ad3ed Revert "floppy: fix open(O_ACCMODE) for ioctl-only open"
[4] f2791e7eadf4 Revert "floppy: refactor open() flags handling"
[5] 8a0c014cd205 floppy: reintroduce O_NDELAY fix

In [1] we tried to fix O_NDELAY behavior because it's hard to define
proper non-blocking behavior for floppies. We also added
"!(mode & (FMODE_READ|FMODE_WRITE))" sanity check for open in that patch.
Motivation for the changes was that it's easy to livelock the system with
floppy's O_NDELAY and syzkaller spotted it. Just for the record, /dev/fd0
is only accessible by the root user in recent distros. 

Patch [1] broke ioctl-only opens in fdutils because:
$ grep -nre open ./setfdprm.c 
60:     if ((fd = open(argv[0],3)) < 0) { /* 3 == no access at all */
Patch [2] reverted "!(mode & (FMODE_READ|FMODE_WRITE))" to fix ioctls.
I guess [2] was not enough and Jens completely reverted [1] with [3] [4].

The last [5] patch restores the open function to the [2] state (it's possible
to use ioctl with open O_ACCMODE). [5] was added because libblkid use O_NONBLOCK
for probing devices, and floppy driver prints many I/O errors to the kernel log.
There are also problems with mounts after. I'm afraid simple revert for [5] is
not enough, otherwise we will face libblkid issues once again.I'll try to test the things and find a more elegant solution.
