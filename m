Yes...

Exactly, thanks for explanation.

We deploy best-effort (BE) jobs (e.g. bigdata, machine learning) and
latency-critical (LC) jobs (e.g. map navigation, payments services) on the
same servers to improve resource utilization. The running time of BE jobs are
very short, but its memory consumption is large, and these jobs will run
periodically. The LC jobs are long-run services and are sensitive to delays
because jitters may cause customer churn.

If a batch of BE jobs are finished simultaneously, lots of memory are freed,
and spinlock contentions happen. BE jobs don't care about these contentions,
but contentions cause them to spend more time in kernel mode, and thus, LC
jobs running on the same cpu cores will be delayed and jitters occur. (The
kernel preemption is disabled on our servers, and we try not to separate
LC/BE using cpuset in order to achieve "complete mixture deployment"). Then
LC services people will complain about the poor service stability. This
scenario has occurred several times, so we want to find a way to avoid it.

Unfortunately, we haven't found an accurate relationship between the
acceptable jitters and the perf percentage. A reference datum is indeed
essential, and we will try to setup it. Thanks for your tips.
