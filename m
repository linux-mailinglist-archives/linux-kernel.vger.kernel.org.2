There seem to be a disconnect here, because it works the other way
around.

If I pull this, I obviously cannot add anything to the patches that
are merged (changing stuff would result in changing the commit IDs,
which is exactly the opposite of what we are trying to achieve).

This isn't a problem, as the act of pulling the branch means that I am
happy with that, and the git merge makes it traceable.

However, some of the patches (the KVM ones) do not carry your own SoB,
which is a problem (if you are picking stuff off the list, you need to
add your own SoB). So for the couple of KVM patches, please add my

	Acked-by: Marc Zyngier <maz@kernel.org>

together with your SoB, resend the PR and I'll gladly merge it.

And if you can make sure the subject lines are formatted as:

	"KVM: arm64: Super Duper feature enablement"

that'd be absolutely awesome (but that's just me being annoying...).

Thanks,

	M.
