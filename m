I live in Africa and used to have this problem before Africa got
connected to fibre optic.  Greg's suggestion of using `wget -c` to
download a git bundle is a good one.  However, in my experience
`wget -c` is not 100% accurate on super flakey internet.  Then if it
fails the verify will fail and you'll have to re-download the entire
thing.

If you want I have a different option.  What I made a clone of Linus's
tree.  Then I did:

tar cvvf linux.tar linux/.git
for i in $(seq 0 116) ; do dd if=linux.tar of=linux.tar.${i} ibs=1M count=20 skip=$((20 * $i)) ; done

Now I have put those on a private webserver I have.  You can download
them by doing:

for i in $(seq 0 116) ; do wget -c http://51.158.124.72/kernel_split/linux.tar.${i} ; done
md5sum * > my_md5s
wget http://51.158.124.72/kernel_split/md5sums
diff -u md5sum my_md5s

Re-download files which don't match

for i in $(seq 0 116) ; do cat linux.tar.${i} >> linux.tar ; done
cat linux.tar | tar xv
cd linux
git reset --hard

Let me know if this works for you.  I will leave the source up for a
week or two before I delete it.

dan carpenter
