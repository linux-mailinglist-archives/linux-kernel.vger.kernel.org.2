It's not clear that this new behaviour is desirable.  For example,
when we construct certain complex algorithms, they may depend on a
generic version of that same algorithm as a fallback.  We do not
want users to get the generic version while the better version is
being tested.

Can you please explain what your failure scenario and perhaps we
can come up with another way of resolving your problem?

Thanks,
