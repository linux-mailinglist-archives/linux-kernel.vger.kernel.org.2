That's generally true for modifying instruction streams though? The man
page for cacheflush(2) calls out that it is not portable.

I think what's necessary here is some mandatory per-arch documentation?

Sure, and I called this case out specifically when I said:

|   * Where we can guarantee that a CPU cannot possibly have an
|     instruction in-flight (e.g. due to a lack of a mapping to fetch
|     instructions from), nothing is necessary. This is what we rely on
|     when faulting in code pages. In these cases, the CPU is liable to
|     take fault on the missing translation anyway.

.. what really matters is whether the CPU had the oppoprtunity to fetch
something stale; the context synchronization is necessary to discard
that.

Bear in mind that in many cases where this could occur in theory, we
don't hit in practice because CPUs don't happen to predict/speculate as
aggressively as they are permitted to. On arm/arm64 it's obvious that
this is a problem because the documentation clearly defines the
boundaries of what a CPU is permitted to do, whereas on other
architectures docuentation is not necessarily as clear whether this is
permited or whether the architecture mandates additional guarantees.

I'm not opposed to adding new interfaces for stuff like that, but I
don't think that membarrier(SYNC_CORE) or cacheflush(2) are necessarily
wrong as-is.

Thanks,
Mark.
