> Xilinx Alveo PCIe cards are predominantly used in x86_64 systems which do=
 not have device tree support compiled into the kernel. XRT driver uses a m=
atching FDT to discover IP subsystems sitting behind the PCIe BARs exposed =
by an Alveo PCIe card. The FDT blob (as part of an Alveo PCIe card firmware=
) can be freely downloaded from xilinx.com.

If the kernel is going to consume that FDT blob, then it needs to
follow upstream practices which primarily means all the device
bindings must be documented with schema and reviewed.


> If using an unflattened tree (instead of FDT) is the right solution then =
we would certainly look into it. Should the PCIe driver then call something=
 like of_fdt_unflatten_tree() with a FDT blob and the kernel would then bui=
ld an unflattened tree and hang it off the PCIe device node? The FDT blob f=
or a PCIe device is only known to the driver since different PCIe platforms=
 may store it differently: a known location in the PCIe BAR, the flash on t=
he PCIe board or a file on the filesystem. If the kernel can provide a gene=
ral on demand unflattening service similar to DTO use model, we will have a=
 more scalable solution to describe IP subsystems exposed by a PCIe device =
and make their discovery data driven. Can this feature also work on x86_64 =
systems which does not use OF?

There's other similar usecases like this. For example, an FTDI or
similar USB to serial chip that has GPIO, I2C, etc. and could have
downstream devices hanging off of those interfaces. And then you could
plug-in multiple of those devices to the host system. For this to
work, we'd need to create a base tree (if there isn't one) with nodes
for the USB or PCI device(s) and then an overlay for the device can be
applied to those nodes. This is also partially an issue on DT based
systems as the DT node may not exist given these are 'discoverable'
buses. It's a bit easier to solve given the PCI host bridge or USB
controller exists in the DT already.

There's really 2 separate parts here. There's how to attach a DT to a
device on a non-DT system (or DT system with a device not described in
the base DT). The second part is how to describe the PCI device and
downstream devices. This part is no different than any other device.

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pci/ and there's the PCI bus schema
here[1]. There's also the OpenFirmware PCI spec[2].
