I see, that could indeed be confusing.

Probably not worth it. We have cond_resched() as a schedule() counterpart
for a reference after all.

I didn't even think that far.
My scenario was:

1.	cookie = start_poll_synchronize_rcu()
 
 
2.	cond_synchronize_rcu() checks the cookie and sees that the
	grace period has not yet expired. So it calls synchronize_rcu()
	which queues a callback.

3.	The grace period for the cookie eventually completes.

4.	The callback queued in 2. gets assigned a new grace period number.
	That new grace period starts.

5.	The new grace period completes and synchronize_rcu() returns.


But I think this is due to some deep misunderstanding from my end.

Yes very nice!

Thanks!
