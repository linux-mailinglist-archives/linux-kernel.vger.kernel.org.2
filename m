Actually this is a rarely happened case that couldn't be reproduced easily
and consistently for further debug. I agreed this should be caused by HW
misconfiguration or even some unknown HW bug that it would send out SPMI
interrupt messages with incorrect APID, but we have never had any chance
to find out the root cause. The patch here simply checked the APID and
bail out if it's not in the valid range, it won't cause anything bad but
improves the SW robustness. After that, the IRQ won't be triggered again
because the latched status in PMIC is not cleared. Also, because of the
access restriction to the registers corresponding to this APID, there is
nothing we can do from APPS processor side to keep it silent.
