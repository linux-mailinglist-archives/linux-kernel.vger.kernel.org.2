I don't feel taken seriously with this reply.

This would be a useful information for the commit log.

It argues why the work around is not needed on non-RT. It might be
obvious for someone who is firm in the RT concepts, but IMHO commit logs
should be understandable by and make sense for a wider audience than the
deep experts. From what I know about RT "Force-threaded interrupt
handlers used to run with interrupts enabled" still applies there.

I'm surprised to hear that from you. With the goal to get RT into
mainline I would expect you to be happy if people consider the effects
on RT in their reviews.

No, I don't consider myself to be an RT expert who is aware of all the
problems. So I admit that for me the effect on RT of the patch under
discussion isn't obvious. I just wonder that the change is justified
with being OK on non-RT. So it's either bad that it breaks RT *or*
improving the commit log would be great.

And even if I had reason to believe that there is no problem with the
commit on RT, I'd still wish that the commit log wouldn't suggest to the
casual reader that there might be a problem.

Best regards
Uwe
