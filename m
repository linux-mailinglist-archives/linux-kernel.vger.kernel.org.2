https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-sbi-doc/releases/tag/v0.3.1-rc1
has:

"This tag the release candidate of version 0.3.1 of the RISC-V SBI 
specification. It doesn't have any significant changes other than typos.
A new release is created to adapt the ratification process for non-ISA 
specifications defined by RVI recently."

Has this patch to wait until release 0.3.1 of the SBI specification is 
ratified?
What is the timeline?

Could you, please, provide a link the the non-ISA ratification process 
description.

Best regards

Heinrich
