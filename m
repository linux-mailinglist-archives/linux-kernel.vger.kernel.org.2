>>> I agree that the there is a bit of loss here due to the FILL mode. But it is not  comparable to that of the ETR. In this case, the WRAP event is triggered when we flush the ETE. i.e, this could be mostly due to the fact that the tracing was enabled for the kernel mode and the last few bytes of trace which caused the FILL belong to the code responsible for stopping the components in the CoreSight trace. I personally do not think this data is of any interest to the user.

But there could be a bit of data that is still cached in the ETE, before it is captured in the trace. And the moment we get a FILL event, we stop executing anything that is relevant for the Trace session (as we are in the driver handling the interrupt).

Agreed, I have included this in the next version.
