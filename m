Thanks for your detailed explanation Stephan. We agree that data from
get_random_bytes is not accounted as entropy, but the question is: is it
still in line with the specification because it uses an algorithm not
compliant to SP800-90B (i.e. ChaCha20 is not a vetted conditioning
component)? Cf. IG 7.19 resolution 6 from 08/28/2020 and IG 7.20 from
05/04/2021.

Good to know. We are worried that a new FIPS validation (started after
November 7, 2020) could failed because of the new SP800-90B requirement.
This issue was pointed out by a lab. It seems that the specification is
still open to different interpretations.
