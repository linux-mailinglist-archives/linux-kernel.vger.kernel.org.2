Hi Michal,

So this patch replaces in enqueue_entity() the unconditional
list_add_leaf_cfs_rq(cfs_rq) in case cfs->nr_running > 1
(parent had been throttled) 

- if (cfs_rq->nr_running == 1 || cfs_bandwidth_used())
                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
with

+ if (cfs_rq->nr_running == 1 && !throttled_hierarchy(cfs_rq))
                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

and removes the leaf_cfs_rq_list maintenance code after the
xxx_throttle label in enqueue_task_fair() and unthrottle_cfs_rq
from commit f6783319737f ("sched/fair: Fix insertion in
rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list") and fe61468b2cb ("sched/fair: Fix
enqueue_task_fair warning").

IMHO, f6783319737f gives the explanation why throttled cfs_rq's have to
be added to rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list.

IIRC, fe61468b2cb was fixing a use case in which a cfs-rq with
on_list=0 and nr_running > 1 within the cgroup hierarchy wasn't
added back to rq->leaf_cfs_rq_list:

https://lkml.kernel.org/r/15252de5-9a2d-19ae-607a-594ee88d1ba1@de.ibm.com

In enqueue_task_fair() just before the assert_list_leaf_cfs_rq(rq),
Iterate through the se heriarchy of p=[CPU 2/KVM 2662] in case the
assert will hit:

...

The leaf_cfs_rq_list should contain all cfs_rqs with
cfs_rq->avg.load/runnable/util_avg != 0 so that in case there are no
runnable entities on them anymore this (blocked) load 
cfs_rq->avg.xxx_avg can be decayed. IMHO. the "leaf_" is misleading
here since it can also contain non-leaf cfs_rqs.
