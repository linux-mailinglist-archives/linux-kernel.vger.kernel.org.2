Ah, you are right! Actually this is explicitly mentioned in the
struct hwrng comments. Thanks for the heads up.

Yeah, that was indeed more a leftover of the version print. I
thought about querying the version again explicitly, but this would
have brought back the SMCCC calls that I could so nicely delete. Plus,
the hwrng driver is just a (secondary) user of this interface, I think
announcing the version should be done in smccc.c. Which is probably
beyond the scope of this patch.

Now thinking about this, there would probably be some value in making
the TRNG UUID somehow available, as this can be used to identify flawed
implementations (general problems in the hardware or backend bugs). But
this should be some query-able interface, rather than some line in
dmesg. Any ideas? Might be beyond the scope of this series, though...

Cheers,
Andre
