From Mr Omra Musa
Bank Of Africa (B.O.A)
Burkina Faso Ouagadougou

My Dear Friend,

Please I want you to read this letter very carefully and I must
apologize for barging this message into your mail box without any
formal introduction due to the urgency and confidential of this issue
and I know that this message will come to you as a surprise. Please
this is not a joke and I will not like you to joke with it.

I am Mr Omra Musa Manager in Bank Of Africa (B.O.A) Ouagadougou,
Burkina Faso. I Hoped that you will not expose or betray this trust
and confident that I am about to establish with you for the mutual
benefit of you and I. This fund was deposited in our bank by Mr.
Kattan Azmal from Jordan who died in a plane crash in 2000 Tbm 700
aircraft on 31st July with his wife and the whole crew on board.

I need your urgent assistance in transferring the sum of ($15) million
USD into your account within 14 working banking days. This money has
been deposited for years in our Bank without claim due to the owner of
this fund died along with his entire family in an air crash since July
31st 2000.

The reason why i contacted you is that after the bank audit in 24th of
November, we found out that this fund has remained unclaimed since the
death of the deceased costumer.

I want our bank to release this fund to you as the nearest person to
our deceased customer while i come over to your country to share this
fund with you as soon as you confirm this fund into your account and
ask me to come over. I don't want the money to go into our Bank
treasure as an abandoned fund. So this is the reason why i contacted
you so that our bank will release this money to you as the next of kin
to the deceased customer. Please I would like you to keep this
proposal as a top secret and delete it if you are not interesting.

Upon the receipt of your reply and indication of your capability, i
will give you full details on how the business will be executed and
also note that you will have 50% of the above mentioned sum if you
agree to handle this business with me while 50% be for me, Because i
don't want anyone here in our bank to know my involvement until you
confirm this fund into your account and ask me to come over for the
sharing as I indicated.

I am looking forward to hear from you immediately for further information
