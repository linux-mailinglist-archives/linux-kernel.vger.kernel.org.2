One problem is when a direct call is 'too far' for a call instruction.
IIRC this can happen in arm64 with modules (all 64bit except x86?).
So an indirect call has to be used instead - which needs the landing pad.
Although it may actually be better to put a trampoline (landing pad
+ near jump) elsewhere and have the module loader do the correct fixup.
(Is the loader already generating a trampoline in the module code?)
The function body can then be cache-line aligned - with its benefits.

Can't anything that can write instructions always use a retpoline
to implement a jump indirect to an arbitrary address?
(Not to mention just generating the required code rather than a call.)

AFAICT CFI is all about detecting invalid values in function pointer tables.
It doesn't really protect in any way from JIT code doing incorrect things.
