Mixing types seems be strongly against in Documentation/filesystems/sysfs.rst.
So in my opinion there should be a determined format for the output. The
concern for this patch is which one is a better format, uuid style or
128 bit raw hex?

And I vote for 128 bit raw hex, as other vendors may not use uuid_t as
the identifier, may be an OF string. So we don't have to force them
decorate it as the uuid style.
