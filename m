We think that using "<384 bits get_random_bytes> || " makes this DRBG
non-compliant with SP800-90A rev1 because get_random_bytes doesn't use a
vetted conditioning component (but ChaCha20 instead):

SP800-90Ar1, section 8.6.5 says "A DRBG mechanism requires an approved
randomness source during instantiation and reseeding [...]. An approved
randomness source is an entropy source that conforms to [SP 800-90B], or
an RBG that conforms to [SP 800-90C] − either a DRBG or an NRBG".
The FIPS 140-2 Implementation Guidance
(https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/documents/fips140-2/fips1402ig.pdf),
section 7.19 says "As of November 7, 2020, all newly submitted modules
requiring an entropy evaluation must demonstrate compliance to SP 800-90B".
In resolution 3 it says "all processing of the raw data output from the
noise sources that happens before it is ultimately output from the
entropy source *shall* occur within a conditioning chain". Data from
get_random_bytes may come from multiple noise sources, but they are
hashed with ChaCha20.
In resolution 6 it says "a vetted conditioning component may optionally
take a finite amount of supplemental data [...] in addition to the data
from the primary noise source", which would be OK if get_random_bytes
used a vetted algorithm, but it is not the case for now.

Agreed, this is the reason we want to keep using urandom, but not as the
entropy input.

The entropy is not destroyed but doesn't seems compliant with the
specification (and IG).
