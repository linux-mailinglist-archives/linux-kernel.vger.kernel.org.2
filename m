Not really immediately.  The memcg that has the most soft limit excess will
be chosen for page reclaim, which is the way it should be.  
It is less likely that a memcg that just exceeded
the soft limit becomes the worst offender immediately.  With the fix, we make
sure that it is on the bad guys list and will not be ignored and be chosen
eventually for reclaim.  It will not sneakily increase its memory usage
slowly.

Lowering the threshold is a band aid that really doesn't fix the problem.
I found that if the cgroup touches the memory infrequently enough, you
could still miss the update of it.  And in the mean time, you are updating
things a lot more frequently with added overhead.
