Not for live patching. I am not sure if I am missing any other valid
use case?

I think the better approach for now is simply to call testers / etc to
deal with this open coded. I cannot be sure that other than live
patching there may be other valid use cases for module removal, and for
races we really may care for where userspace *will* typically be mucking
with sysfs attributes. Monitoring my systems's sysfs attributes I am
actually quite surprised at the random pokes at them.

Should we document this as well? Without this it is unclear that tons of
random tests are sanely nullified. At least this dead lock I spotted can
be pretty common form on many drivers.

Driver developers will simply have to open code these protections. In
light of what I see on LTP / fuzzing, I suspect the use case will grow
and we'll have to revisit this in the future. But for now, sure, we can
just open code the required protections everywhere to not crash on module
removal.
