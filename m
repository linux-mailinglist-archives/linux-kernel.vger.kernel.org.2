Maybe that can be done for the next merge window? I'd like to get the
smallest possible patch in as a fix for this cycle given that the Fixes
tag is a recent regression introduced during the most recent merge
window.

I honestly have no idea what's going on with the clk driver in these
files but from the clk framework perspective there are bigger problems
than caching the vco freq properly. As I stated in the commit text
above, calling set_rate from prepare is plain bad. That should stop.

From my quick glance, the patch you mention looks like another
workaround instead of a proper fix. Why would we need to save the
registers at boot and then snap them back into place on enable? Maybe we
shouldn't reset the phy after registering the clks? Instead register the
clks after the phy is reset so recalc_rate can accurately calculate the
frequency. I suppose that would break continuous splash screen though
where you want the PLL to stay running the entire boot? But then
issuing a reset would break that, wouldn't it? As you can see I'm pretty
confused about how this is all supposed to work.

Note: my problem isn't about recovering what boot sets, it's mostly
exposing incorrect usage of the clk framework in this driver because it
relies on this chain of events:

 1) recalc rate calculates something different than what is
    set via clk_set_rate()

 2) clk_set_rate() is called with the different rate

 3) clk_prepare() is called to actually enable the PLL and wait for it
    to start

If clk_prepare() was called before clk_set_rate(), which is totally
valid, then it should similarly fail and think the rate is 0 and the PLL
won't lock. Does implementing save_state fix that? If so, it seems like
we have two pieces of code working around each other, maybe for
suspend/resume purposes.

I admit this patch I'm proposing is another workaround, but at least it
makes things work again without going off and adding a bunch of register
save/restore logic.
