Hi Bjorn,
sorry for the very late reply... I've been really too busy lately.

Unless I got something wrong, yes it's true that CPR-Hardened setup is
done in FW on 845, but the GPU CPR is not... and that's why it's in the
list :))

Future plans are to extend this driver to deal with GPU related CPR as
well as the CPU one.

Yes, I do. Though, my intention here is to not throw too many things
into the game in this version of a very complicated driver... besides,
I currently can't test 8996 efficiently but maybe later!

Since it is our (SoMainline) intention to also get all (or most of) our
MSM8996 devices kicking on upstream, I'm sure that we'll throw that data
in the CPR mix as soon as possible.

Eventually, I can also send the 8996 data addition separately even if
untested and clearly specifying so, even though I don't like sending
untested things.

There is little reason, looking at the code size, but here's the deal:

On CPRv3/v4 (non-hardened), you do an initial programming sequence,
then for each frequency step you assign a corner (in software) and
whenever your driver requests a OPP change, the CPR driver will write
a corner level (also managing ACC and other stuff "manually") to the
hardware, which will then behave (blahblah); in this case, we are also
managing the CPR interrupts (as they are necessary to "play" with the
states).

On CPR-Hardened (or CPRv4-Hardened if you like), you still do an initial
programming sequence, but then you do nothing else. Literally.
CPR-Hardened is not made to be managed from the HLOS - that's made to be
managed "internally" by the Operating State Manager (OSM) which, after
getting programmed with matching values from CPR-Hardened, will request
corners to the CPR (and also manage ACC).

So, in short, the difference between CPR v3/v4 and CPR Hardened is:
- CPRv3/v4 is programmed by HLOS and managed by HLOS
- CPRh is programmed by HLOS and managed by OSM.


Now, the reason why I had defaulted this to relaxed accessors was that
in the CPRv3/v4 case we're setting the corners from HLOS, so I wanted to
get the best performance out of that operation.

Though, looking back at it, that's not a very safe thing to do, it is
indeed prone to mistakes, and if some of the writes won't go through, we
will end up with an undervolted CPU, which may be "catastrophic";

Re-analyzing the situation, I would have to put some more wmb() around
to make sure that this doesn't happen, but then the added overhead of
having all the registers R/W with non-relaxed accessors happens to be
very, very minimal.


Which means that, in the end, you're right - I've switched them to their
non-relaxed counterparts and biting the truly minimal and completely
unnoticeable overhead.

Thank you for the review, Bjorn. Totally appreciated.
