The problem seems to be that we call perf_event_set_output() before we
set event->ctx, which is a bit of a problem.

Now, afaict it's been broken since c3f00c70276d ("perf: Separate
find_get_context() from event initialization"), which is ages ago :/

It's waaay too late to try and fix it; I'll be likely to make an even
bigger mess if I tried. Perhaps tomorrow.

Clearly FD_OUTPUT isn't much used :-(
