I looked it up, it adds some fairly heavy serialising instructions
after the unconditional jump.
For BLR (call indirect) it has to use a BL (call) to an indirect jump.

I don't know if the execution of the serialising instructions
gets aborted.
If not you could end up with unexpected delays - like those on
some x86 cpu when they speculatively executed trig functions.

It all seems pretty broken though.
I'd expect the branch prediction unit to speculate at the jump
target for 'predicted taken' conditional jumps.
So you'd really expect unconditional jumps to behave the same way.
BLR ought to be using the branch target buffer (BTB).

(It isn't actually 100% clear that some processors don't use the BTB
for non-indirect jumps though....)
