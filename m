Basically, almost all UFS failures are caused by errors in underlaying 
layers,
i.e., UIC errors, including link transition failures. And according to 
UFSHCI
spec, SW should do a full reset to recover it, just like handle any 
other
fatal UIC errors. All UIC errors are detected by HW and reported by IRQ 
handler.

UFSHCI Spec Ver. 31
8.2.7 Hibernate Enter/Exit Error Handling
Hibernate Enter/Exit Error occurs when the UniPro link is broken. When 
this condition occurs,
host software should reset the host controller by setting register HCE 
to ‘0’, re-initialize the host
controller by setting register HCE to ‘1', and then start link startup 
sequence as shown in Figure 16.

I've explained why I chose not to do this in my last reply to Adrian.
Please kindly check it.

I was aware of it, but the situation is that host_sem is also used to
avoid concurrency among user access, error handling and shutdown, so
I think just use host_sem anyways to simply the lockings, otherwise
user access and error handling would have to take both 
system_transition_mutex
and host_sem
