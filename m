The above is the original data of ext4_prealloc_space(0xffff880268291d78 
- 0x10). After formatting, it is as follows:

crash> struct ext4_prealloc_space  0xffff880268291d68
struct ext4_prealloc_space {
   pa_inode_list = {
     next = 0xffff881822f8a4c8,
     prev = 0xffff881822f8a4c8
   },
   pa_group_list = {
     next = 0xffff8813bb5f72f0,
     prev = 0xffff8813bb5f72f0
   },
   u = {
     pa_tmp_list = {

     pa_rcu = {
       next = 0x1000,
       func = 0xffff880db2371000
     }
   },
   pa_lock = {
     {
       rlock = {
         raw_lock = {
           {
             val = {
               counter = 0
             },
             {
               locked = 0 '\000',
               pending = 0 '\000'
             },
             {
               locked_pending = 0,
               tail = 0
             }
           }
         }
       }
     }
   },
   pa_count = {
     counter = 1
   },
   pa_deleted = 0,
   pa_pstart = 171065,
   pa_lstart = 3137,

   pa_type = 0,
   pa_obj_lock = 0xffff881822f8a4d8,
   pa_inode = 0xffff881822f8a268

It is a legal data, which can be verified by pa_inode£º

At this time, some logs are lost. It is suspected that the hard disk 
itself is faulty.

There are many hard disks on our server. Maybe we should not occupy 100% 
CPU for a long time just because one hard disk fails.

Please check the patch below again, thanks

This is a real workload.
More detailed information is still being collected. At present, we only 
analyze it based on the vmcore.
