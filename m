This message might come to you as surprises today, I just wanted to
inform you that It is a very joyful moment for me to share this good
news with you, although i have really missed you because you give me
the faith to carry on despite all that happened,you really brought
hope to my hopeless situation then, therefore i made a vow to myself
that even if we fail to complete the transaction together,i must
surely still compensate you.

To be very honest with you, It is a joyful moment for me and my family
right now, so therefore am using this opportunity to inform you that
have successfully move to Vietnam where am currently living with my
business partner who assisted me to complete the transfer, but due to
the willingness and acceptance you showed during my pain have decided
to willingly compensated you and show my gratitude to you with these
sum of $950,000.00 Nine Hundred and fifty Thousand US Dollars).

I want you to accept it as a gift from the bottom of my heart, Have
issued the check and I instructed the bank to roll the fund on an ATM
credit card for security reasons,you can use the ATM card to withdraw
money from any ATM machine world wide with a maximum of US$10,000
daily.

This vow I made to myself about compensating you has been in my mind
so I am here to fulfill it to you, although I did not tell you what
was in my mind, my bank account manager said you can receive the card
and use it anywhere in this global world. Go ahead contact the Global
