I think the bulk of user issues are going to be regressions. Although you
may be in a better position to know for sure, but at least for me, wearing
my "user" hat, the thing that gets me the most is upgrading to a new kernel
and suddenly something that use to work no longer does. And that is the
definition of a regression. My test boxes still run old distros (one is
running fedora 13). These are the boxes that catch the most issues, and if
they do, they are pretty much guaranteed to be a regression.

I like the "linux-regressions" mailing list idea.
