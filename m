 So it does trigger with vgacon and my old server, which I have started 
experimenting with and for a start I have switched to a new kernel for an 
unrelated purpose (now that I have relieved it from all its usual tasks 
except for the last remaining one for which I haven't got the required 
user software ported to the new system yet):

"struct vt_consize"->v_vlin is ignored. Please report if you need this.
"struct vt_consize"->v_clin is ignored. Please report if you need this.

It continues using svgatextmode with its glass (CRT) VT to set my usual 
80x37 text mode (720x576 pixel resolution) by manipulating the VGA clock 
chip and the CRT controller appropriately for a nice refresh rate of 85Hz:

Chipset = `TVGA8900', Textmode clock = 44.90 MHz, 80x37 chars, CharCell = 9x16. Refresh = 52.51kHz/84.7Hz.

 Indeed the piece of software became less usable around Y2K as clock chip 
support stopped being added to svgatextmode for new video adapters, but 
with the advent of LCD technology and its disregard for the refresh rate 
previously driven by the pixel clock the program got its second life and I 
have used it ever since with its plain VGA driver by just manipulating the 
CRTC for the resolution required:

Chipset = `VGA', Textmode clock = 28.32 MHz, 80x37 chars, CharCell = 9x16. Refresh = 31.47kHz/49.0Hz.

(that would still work with a standard 800x600 SVGA CRT, but the refresh 
rate would make anyone's eyes cry soon; with LCD it's just awesome, and 
the VGA emulation of the actual graphics adapter turns it at the video 
output into a 1600x1200 picture at the horizontal and vertical rates of 
75KHz and 60Hz respectively, making the text produced on LCD outstanding 
while showing about the right amount of it).

 But I'm currently ~160km/100mi away from the server I have triggered this 
message with, so I cannot easily check what's going on with its VT.  And I 
can't fiddle with my production laptop (ThinkPad P51) I have with me that 
I also use svgatextmode with so much as to reboot it with a new kernel 
(plain Debian 4.19.16-1~bpo9+1 still here).

 So what's the supposed impact of this change that prompted the inclusion 
of the messages?  I can port svgatextmode (it's my own compilation anyway) 
if that is required for it to continue working correctly, but I need to 
understand the circumstances here.  I have failed to find a satisfactory 
alternative solution to vgacon and svgatextmode; the main showstopper is 
the IBM's hardware trick for a 9x16 character cell that I rely on.
