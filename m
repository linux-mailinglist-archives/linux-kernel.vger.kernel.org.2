Right, for situations where we use assign-clock-rates to drive up the
clock rate this mechanism might be needed in order to keep things
stable.

But I presume as soon as you have some sort of dynamic nature to that
you'll be back to an opp-table and the means we already have.

That would be much appreciated, I've not done extensive testing myself,
mostly just booted a few different boards.

But I would like to see us correct the MDSS_GDSC->MMCX setup in time for
v5.15, in particular since we have a few new users of the mmcx
power-domain-regulator arriving in this cycle.
