Sadly, that only works on symbol names, so we cannot use it to strip
CFI-ness from void *func arguments passed into the static call API,
unfortunately.

Also, function_nocfi() seems broken in the sense that it relies on the
symbol existing in the global namespace, which may not be true for
function symbols with static linkage, as they can be optimized away
entirely. I think the same might apply to function symbols with
external linkage under LTO.
