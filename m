I guess this kind of inaccuracy is fine. I just don't like much
fold_vm_zone_numa_events() which seems to calculate sums of percpu counters and
then assign the result to zone counters for immediate consumption, which differs
from other kinds of folds in vmstat that reset the percpu counters to 0 as they
are treated as diffs to the global counters.

So it seems that this intermediate assignment to zone counters (using
atomic_long_set() even) is unnecessary and this could mimic sum_vm_events() that
just does the summation on a local array?

And probably a bit more serious is that vm_events have vm_events_fold_cpu() to
deal with a cpu going away, but after your patch the stats counted on a cpu just
disapepar from the sums as it goes offline as there's no such thing for the numa
counters.

Thanks,
Vlastimil
