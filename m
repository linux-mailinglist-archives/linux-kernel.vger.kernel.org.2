The regulator-{min/max}-microamp is the equivalent of the downstream
"qcom,qpnp-lab-limit-maximum-current" and 
"qcom,qpnp-ibb-limit-maximum-current.

I am sorry if we haven't sent our patch series that will introduce the
Sony MSM8998 Yoshino and SDM630/636 Nile and Ganges platforms, which
are actually using the driver that I've sent fully, as these would have
been a nice reference for you.

In any case, I can point you at our public repositories and their
downstream equivalents...

Here you find the downstream configuration for LAB/IBB:
https://github.com/sonyxperiadev/kernel/blob/aosp/LA.UM.7.1.r1/arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/msm8998-yoshino-common.dtsi#L3158

...And here you find the SoMainline upstream stuff for the same:
https://github.com/SoMainline/linux/blob/SoMainline/v5.11-rc4/arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/msm8998-sony-xperia-yoshino.dtsi#L332

https://github.com/SoMainline/linux/blob/SoMainline/v5.11-rc4/arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/msm8998-sony-xperia-yoshino-maple.dts#L50

I hope that clears out your doubts and difficulties about implementing
the protections on labibb.

Yours,
-- Angelo
