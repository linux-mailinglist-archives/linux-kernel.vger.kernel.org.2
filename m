Dear Sir,

This is a private effort to introduce a partnership intention to you.

I am doing this on behalf of a group of career public servants from Asia.

We plan to venture into an investment profile of large volume, for which we seek to engage you as our representative.

Though our proposed remuneration package is impressive, it is made flexible enough to accommodate some adjustment if necessary, and the candidate we want for the position is someone from your Country.

If this is something you can do, I will appreciate your early response, so that I can provide more and appropriate details of the entire proposal.

Regards,

Chu Tse Wang
