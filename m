I'd rather have it done early on. If we know there's a better way of
doing something and we don't the code should go into staging.

This gives us an out if it doesn't happen, otherwise the kernel

Note, I'm not trying to say there's any ill will anywhere, Xilinx has
been traditionally good about this :)
