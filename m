Yes, but that's a different set of problems

Ok, at least that makes it easier.

I thought you were trying to solve the problem where DRMA_ASPEED_GFX
can optionally link against CMA but would fail to build when the CMA code
is in a loadable module.

If the problem you are trying to solve is a different one, you need a different
solution, not what I posted above.

That used to be the meaning, but it changed a few years ago. Now
it means "when a used manually turns on this symbol, turn on the
implied one as well, but let them turn it off again if they choose".

This is pretty much a NOP.

The example I gave is only meaningful if both are tristate, which is
not the case here as you explain.

It is a somewhat awkward way to say "prevent this symbol from
being =y if the dependency is =m".
