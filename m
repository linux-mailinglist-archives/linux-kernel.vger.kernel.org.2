It seems like both histograms and filter both reference field flags to
determine how to get the data.

How would you feel about another FILTER_* flag on fields, like:
FILTER_DYN_STRING_SAFE
FILTER_PTR_STRING_SAFE

user_events when parsing would instead of leaving FILTER_OTHER for
__data_loc / __rel_loc switch to the above.

The predicate filter method would then switch based on those types to
safer versions.

That way other parts could take advantage of this if needed beyond
user_events.

If this is addressed at the filter/histogram level, would then the write
callsites still check bounds per-write? Or maybe only care about the
undersized data cases?
