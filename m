Did that require significant changes? I'd like to be able to run the
tests locally if possible.

Sure; doing that in armv8pmu_enable_user_access() makes sense to me,
given it's not exposed to userspace otherwise, and the kernel itself
doesn't care.

If we do that, I think that we should document that it may be zero'd
arbitrarily from userspace's PoV. That should only need a sentence or
two in the documentation added in the final patch.

Thanks,
Mark.
