You can always do the allocation and free outside the rwlock_t.

	new_data = alloc();
	lock();
	update new_data with old_data
	ptr = new_data;
	unlock();
	free old_data

And is the preferred method, as we don't want allocation or freeing done
inside the locking (especially on RT, where rwlocks are not "special").

The main concern is cache contention with the updates, even among readers.
That is, readers may not block on each other, but the accessing of the same
lock will cause cache contention.

And writers will block. I don't remember if rwlocks are fair or not (when a
writer blocks, all new readers block too.) I think it is.

For RCU, it's how you free it. You can push it off to a queue, if you have
a field in the data structure that can be added to the rcu link list that
wont affect the readers.

If you are concerned about the contention between readers, then RCU is the
way to go, as it doesn't have that issue.
