It's a judgement call, really...

Doh! You're correct -- I was thinking about getxattr, but setxattr
doesn't have the same ops vectors. We could add a new option to vet
setxattr requests locally, but that might not be sufficient actually...

Now that I think about it some more, we probably need to let the MDS vet
these requests. It's possible that we'd do a lookup of the inode and
then call setxattr on it concurrently with another client making the
inode encrypted.

We could ensure that we have As caps here to try to prevent that, but it
hardly seems worthwhile. These are not commonly changed. It seems best
to just let the MDS gather the appropriate locks and handle it there.
