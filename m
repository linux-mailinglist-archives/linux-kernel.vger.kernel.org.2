Sometimes it's "DM", other times it's "dm" device. Please be consistent.

          Either       they are able to change the behavior of any
            or         they will be able to change the behavior of any

I prefer the first choice.

According to Documentation/doc-guide/sphinx.rst, here is how
chapters, sections, etc., should be indicated:


* Please stick to this order of heading adornments:

  1. ``=`` with overline for document title::

       ==============
       Document title
       ==============

  2. ``=`` for chapters::

       Chapters
       ========

  3. ``-`` for sections::

       Section
       -------

  4. ``~`` for subsections::

       Subsection
       ~~~~~~~~~~

  Although RST doesn't mandate a specific order ("Rather than imposing a fixed
  number and order of section title adornment styles, the order enforced will be
  the order as encountered."), having the higher levels the same overall makes
  it easier to follow the documents.



thanks.
