What would be the reason two always create a cycle which gives no 
additional information? Maybe I'm just misunderstanding this piece of code.

Regarding your commit message. Even if there is a non-remote-endpoint 
dependency, it will be hidden by the remote-endpoint cycle.

And another consequence of remote-endpoint loops.

Consider this part part of dmesg. One warning is correct (real cyclic 
dependency). Others are remote-endpoint spam. Can you spot, which ones?

It is "1".

After doing the analysis, I can confirm that I was too quick regarding 
the mdss links preventing it from being probed. Sorry about that.

It all went up to the DP phy having a link with usb-c-connector. I was 
running the kernel 5.15-rc1, so your tcpm fix is already present. 
However my colleague has disabled the tcpm device (which I did not 
notice). So the driver did not call fw_devlink_purge_absent_suppliers().
The devlink still exists:

[   53.426446] platform 88e9000.phy: probe deferral - wait for supplier 
connector

However it is not present in the sysfs:

waiting_for_supplier

Thus it is not possible to spot this device link without 
CONFIG_DEBUG_DRIVER=y (or any similar debugging technique).

If I re-enabled tcpm device or if I reverted remote-endpoint parsing, DP 
PHY probing would go fine. The DP PHY does not really depend on the 
connector (or TCPM) being present in the system. The driver will 
continue working w/o it. However it does not have a change to declare that.

Furthermore I went back to the original case that caused you to add 
remote-endpoint support. The DSI-eDP bridge and eDP panel using the GPIO 
provided by that bridge. I think the proper fix for the original problem 
was implemented by the commit bf73537f411b ("drm/bridge: ti-sn65dsi86: 
Break GPIO and MIPI-to-eDP bridge into sub-drivers"). It split the 
DSI-eDP bridge driver into functional parts (devices), so that GPIO part 
and eDP parts are independent, thus breaking this cyclic dependency in a 
functional way. The remote-endpoint parsing is no longer necessary in 
this case (Stephen, please correct me if I'm wrong).


I still think that remote endpoint parsing does more harm and noise than 
good and thus should be reverted.
