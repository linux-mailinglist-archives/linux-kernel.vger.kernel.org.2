The "Prime Directive of Linux development" is the tree falling in the
forest approach. If you break user space API but there's no user space
application around to notice the break, did you really break it? The answer
is "No".

I'm fine with adding this. But I'm going to add it after the merge window
for the next release (5.16).

If someone complains that it broke their application, we may need to revert
it, but I doubt that will happen.
