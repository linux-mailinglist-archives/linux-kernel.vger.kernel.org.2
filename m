That would be fine if regmap_debugfs_init() didn't do a lot more than
just create the debugfs directory. I'm more concerned about the mutex
and list head initialization that is happening on an already
initialized structure. I haven't looked in detail what the mutex and
list head are used for, but I assume bad thingsâ„¢ are going to happen
when someone is already holding the mutex or using the list.
