It panics. Please, you know exactly what Sathya meant because you've 
read the code.

Sorry this is ridiculous. We're not in a make-work project here. We're 
about practical engineeringÂ  not make out life artificially complicated.

If that is what is required then the change requests to NOT ignore but 
patch every site were just not practical.

Okay then we just go back to ignore like the rest of the KVM world.

That's what we had originally and it it's fine because it's exactly what 
KVM does, which is all we want.

It was the sane thing to do and it's still the sane thing to do because 
it has been always done this way.
