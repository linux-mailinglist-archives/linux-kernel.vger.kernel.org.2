 The TIOCGSERIAL/TIOCSSERIAL ioctls.  It's not clear to me why you're 
asking; as a serial driver expert you must have been surely aware of their 
existence.

 You can program the divider registers directly with any bit pattern 
supported by hardware.  You don't know what use for it has been out there 
in the field for the last ~30 years.

 It is there and the presence or absence of the feature for OxSemi devices 
does not affect anything but OxSemi support code.

 It is currently a supported feature for OxSemi devices (and most if not 
all 8250 derivatives), and I don't see a reason to selectively remove it 
with this specifice submission.  There may be installations out there that 
rely on it -- there have been shortcomings in the implementation, which 
are the motivation for this patch series, but mind that we've had support 
for OxSemi Tornado devices since 2008.  That's a lot of time.

 Driver writers for other UART implementations may choose to have it or 
not to with their new code written from scratch.  As a matter of interest 
I've checked zs.c, one of the serial hw drivers I had considerable input 
to and it uses its own ZS_BPS_TO_BRG macro rather than `uart_get_divisor', 
so it does not support this feature (and dz.c only has a set of 15 fixed 
baud rates, which is where the original termio B<rate> macro bit patterns, 
as well as the EXTA and EXTB macros for the externally supplied clock 
chosen by the 16th bit pattern, come from).

 And as I say: if you want to remove it, then do it globally and tell 
people that as from Linux x.y.z this feature is no longer supported, so 
that is clear and unambiguos and some poor IT soul out there does not get 
hit by a random obscure driver feature removal with a kernel upgrade.

 NB in the course of this effort I've learnt the hard way that `setserial' 
is even invoked automatically nowadays in startup/shutdown scripts for 
port state saving and restoration, so a random unannounced feature removal 
here can wreak havoc with people's installations they have configured 
years ago.

 Just pointing out the incompleteness of the implementation should 
SPD_CUST be removed.

 Based on my consideration given above, no, I maintain keeping the feature 
is the right approach, at least for this change concerned.  After all its 
purpose is to correct baud rate setting and not to remove vaguely related 
features.

 Why would a non-developer need to dive into it while also hesitating to 
go through the git log?  Moreover, why would a developer hesitate digging 
through the git log while trying to understand code?

 Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but coming from long before we had any sensible 
repository (umm, the MIPS port and I believe m68k had CVS in the old days, 
but try to find anything with CVS!) let alone git I can't overrate my 
appreciation for its features, and our requirement for sensible change 
descriptions is not there for nothing.  So looking through `git log' is 
the first thing I do when I want to understand why a piece of code unknown 
to me looks like it does.

 Not a new driver really, but a bug fix for the broken calculation we 
currently have given how inaccurately the particular input clock rate 
chosen by the designer of the ASIC gets divided at least for some of our 
standard baud rates.  You may have seen with my previous fix that the 
original submitter for the OxSemi handlers didn't even get the base baud 
rate right (and that stuff has been included as vendor-supplied drivers 
with various OxSemi-based serial port card manufacturers!), so I can't 
really tell what happened there.

 It looks to me like nice if not ultimate UART hardware ruined by broken 
software, sigh.  Which may have contributed to the withdrawal of the ASICs 
from manufacturing as with the extra quality stripped by missing software 
support obviously they may not have been able to compete solely by price 
with cheap UARTs made elsewhere that provide a basic feature set only (and 
no documentation).

 NB it does DMA as one would expect especially at the higher baud rates, 
and earlier OxSemi PCI or discrete UARTs have similar features (including 
the clock prescaler), none of which we handle.  If we started, only then I 
guess we could call it a new driver.  I have the datasheets, but I can't 
dedicate more time I'm afraid beyond what is absolutely necessary to get 
the broken PCIe stuff right.

 OK though, you've convinced me.

 Not for serial hardware drivers, but a while ago I committed what now 
lives at Documentation/networking/device_drivers/fddi/defza.rst along with 
several other networking driver notes, so I imagine we can have a similar 
collection for 8250 stuff and the like.

 OK, the size argument alone makes some sense to me, though OTOH splitting 
sources into many files prevents the compiler from doing interprocedural 
optimisations, which can only be partially compensated by LTO (if enabled 
in the first place).

 I'll see what I can do here anyway.  Mind that non-PCIe OxSemi stuff 
remains incomplete, as I noted above, so it'll be a partial driver anyway.

 Well, the algorithm is for finding the closest rational number expressed 
by a numerator and a denominator to the required one.  We have no problem 
with that, because the divisor is integer (which is of course a rational 
number too, but finding the numerator where the denominator if constant 1 
is trivial).

 Well, I considered a naïve algorithm, but it would be quadratic, it would 
make a lot of redundant calculations, and division is not exactly a fast 
operation; some targets we support have no hardware division instruction 
even.  Needless to say it would still have to encode the ranges supported.  
And any code size gain from the naïve algorithm might still not match the 
268 bytes the table consumes, especially with RISC targets.

 I think my proposal is a reasonable compromise that addresses the problem 
at hand, and if you or anyone else finds a better solution sometime, then 
you are free to improve it.  Perfect is the enemy of good enough, so the 
potential existence of an ultimate solution that hasn't been discovered 
yet shouldn't block progress in a hope that the solution gets found soon 
enough.

 I'll repost the outstanding pieces of the series with the adjustments I 
have agreed to make.
