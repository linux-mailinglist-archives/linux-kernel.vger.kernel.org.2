OK, I buy this, thanks.

The code is structured now in a way that is trivial to remove the global
list and move on to just node lists. I.e. nasty section lists have been
wiped away. Refactoring global list out is a trivial step.  

That way this is a step forwards, even if having a global list would
be step backwards:-)

I'll dissolve your feedback and come with the new version, which I'll
put out tomorrow.

PS. If you don't here of me after you have given feedback to the next
version, please ping privately. It looks like things are getting through
again fast but better be sure than sorry...
