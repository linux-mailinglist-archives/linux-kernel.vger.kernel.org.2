When does this occur? Upgrade from page mappings to block? Swap out?

Let me see if I understand this. Assuming 4k pages, the region
described above spans *two* 2M entries:

(a) ff00ab2000-ff00c00000, part of ff00a00000-ff00c00000
(b) ff00c00000-ff00db2000, part of ff00c00000-ff00e00000

(a) has no valid mapping, but (b) does. Because we fail to correctly
align on a block boundary when skipping (a), we also skip (b), which
is then left mapped.

Did I get it right? If so, yes, this is... annoying.

Understanding the circumstances this triggers in would be most
interesting. This current code seems to assume that we get ranges
aligned to mapping boundaries, but I seem to remember that the old
code did use the stage2_*_addr_end() helpers to deal with this case.

Will: I don't think things have changed in that respect, right?

The workload on its own isn't that interesting. What I'd like to
understand is what happens on the host during that time.

It otherwise looks good to me. Quentin, Will: unless you object to
this, I plan to take it in the next round of fixes with
