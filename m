My patch is only touching samsung_cmu_register_one(), and
exynos5433_cmu_probe() doesn't call samsung_cmu_register_one(). So I
don't think there can be a problem there. Or I'm missing something?

samsung_cmu_register_one() is actually called from 5433 clk driver,
but only from CMUs registered with CLK_OF_DECLARE(), and those are not
setting .clk_name field, so my code is not affecting those either.

Real problem I can see is that I can't avoid using __clk_lookup() if I
implement that code in samsung_cmu_register_one(). Tried to do use
clk_get(NULL, ...) instead, but it doesn't work with 1st param (dev)
being NULL, because samsung_clk_register_*() functions don't register
clkdev (only samsung_clk_register_fixed_rate() does), hence
LIST_HEAD(clocks) is empty in clkdev.c, and clk_get() fails, when not
provided with actual 'dev' param, which in turn is not present in
samsung_cmu_register_one()...

About using platform_driver: as I can see from clk-exynos5433.c, only
CMUs which belong to Power Domains are registered as platform_driver.
Rest of CMUs are registered using CLK_OF_DECLARE(), thus they don't
get platform_device param. That makes it harder to avoid using
__clk_lookup() inside samsung_cmu_register_one().

All that said, I feel like correct way to implement this patch would be:
  1. Register all PD-capable CMUs as platform_driver in clk-exynos850
(all CMUs except CMU_TOP)
  2. Move bus clock enablement code from samsung_cmu_register_one() to
corresponding clk-exynos850 probe function

This way I would be able to use clk_get(dev, ...) instead of
__clk_lookup(), and that won't affect any existing code for sure. Code
will be more unified w.r.t. how it's done in clk-exynos5433, and
platform_device will be a foundation for implementing PM ops later.
Taking into account how much design decisions should be done for using
that in common code -- I'd say let's do that later, as a separate
refactoring activity.

Do you think that makes sense?
