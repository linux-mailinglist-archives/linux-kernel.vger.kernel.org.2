Ok.

Isn't this already covered by the definition of ports ? There are no 
fixed connections for ETE. It is optional and could be connected to
any legacy CoreSight component. i.e, a "ports" object can have port
objects inside.

Given we have defined out-ports as an object "confirming to the ports"
do we need to describe the individual port nodes ?
