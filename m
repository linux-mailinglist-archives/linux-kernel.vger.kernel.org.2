If we vote for a corner based on the link rate in *_configure_dp_phy()
and put the vote for lowest corner we'd get the corner part sorted out
afaict.

We'd still have to make sure that the PHY doesn't hang on to the cx vote
beyond that though - and implicitly in the non-DP cases...

I haven't checked sc7180, but I'm guessing that it's following the other
modern platforms, where all the MDSS related pieces (including e.g.
dispcc) lives in the MMCX domain, which is separate from CX.

So the parent of MDSS_GDSC should be MMCX, while Kuogee's answer (and
the dp-opp-table) tells us that the PLL lives in the CX domain.


PS. While this goes for the QMPs the DSI and eDP/DP PHYs (and PLLs)
seems to live in MMCX.
