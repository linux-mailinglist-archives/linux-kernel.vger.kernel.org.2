What can you try is to somehow cut the sections during linking phase
if you know, that OF=n, or ACPI=n. Not sure how it would work, because
basically we will need to replace them with stubs to prevent drivers
from crashing. Nevertheless, One terminator entry is much better than
full bloated ID table(s)!

You're welcome!

FWIW, I have sent my version of the patch, you are in Cc list there,
can you test and confirm that warning is gone for you?
