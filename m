Thank you for your opinion and suggestions. In fact I'm probably going 
to start working on non-discoverable busses first (by chaning support 
for few other BT+WiFi Qualcomm chips), later shifting the attention to 
the PCIe part. While this may seem like a longer path, I'd like to 
narrow pwrseq subsystem first, before going into PCIe details.
