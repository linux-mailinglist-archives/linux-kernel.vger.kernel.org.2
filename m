Let me explain.
1) it is not trivial to use current allocation fault injection to cause
a small proportion of vmalloc() calls to artificially fail.

vmalloc
 __vmalloc_node
  __vmalloc_node_range
   __vmalloc_area_node
    vm_area_alloc_pages
 
vm_area_alloc_pages uses new __alloc_pages_bulk subsystem, requesting up to 100 pages in cycle.
__alloc_pages_bulk() can be interrupted by allocation fault injection, however in this case
vm_area_alloc_pages() will failback to old-style page allocation cycle.
In general case it successfully finishes allocation and vmalloc itself will not fail.

To fail vmalloc we need to fail both alloc_pages_bulk_array_node() and alloc_pages_node() together.

2) if we failed single vmalloc it is not enough.
I would remind, we want to emulate fatal signal reaction.
However I afraid dying task can execute a quite complex rollback procedure.
This rollback can call another vmalloc and last one will be failed
again on fatal_signal_pending check.

To emulate this behavior in fault injection we need to disable all following
vmalloc calls of our victim, pseudo-"dying" task.

I doubt both these goals can be reached by current allocation fault injection subsystem,
I do not understand how to configure it accordingly.

Thank you,
