Sorry for that. Sometime it does happen. Anyways thanks for reminding about
it.

Mark has already acked it, so you can take it via your tree if you are OK.

We generally ask the author to post to soc@kernel.org for one of patches
like this when we don't have any plans to send PR to SoC team so that they
can apply the patch directly.

So it should be fine if you prefer to pick up and send to SoC team or we
can resend the patch to them and ask to apply. Let us know.
