I've just seen the latest reports on these data races [1], but it seems
the more relevant context is here.

Let me try to put things in perspective.

No, we do not want maintainability to suffer. Whether or not documenting
the concurrency design via data_race() and a few comments is a negative
or positive is up to you. To me, it'd be a positive because I don't have
to guess what the code is trying to do because concurrent code rarely is
obvious. (In fairness, if you don't like to add comments, just a
data_race() without comment tells a reader more than now; perhaps they'd
then rummage in the git logs.)

Yes, there are currently lots of data-racy accesses in the kernel that
are mostly benign. Yet, they are data races in the memory model's eyes,
and every optimizing compiler is free to screw them up! For example a
lot of those plain read-modify-write bitops ("...  |= ...").

Unfortunately tooling cannot determine without hints (like data_race())
whether or not those are safe, since the programmer's intent is unclear.
Crucially, the programmer's intent is also unclear to the compiler!
Which means the compiler _is_ free to screw up those operations.

If we could somehow precisely determine which plain accesses can race,
we'd solve a decades-old problem: optimizing compilers and concurrent
code do not get along. Therefore, C needed a memory model to sort out
this mess, which we have since C11. The Linux kernel, however, doesn't
play by those rules. The Linux Kernel Memory Model (LKMM) tries to
specify the rules the kernel can safely play by.

But since we have KCSAN, which initially tried to follow the LKMM
strictly, various feedback has resulted in taming KCSAN to a subset of
the LKMM. A lot of the data races that are left, yet appear benign,
simply have no obvious rules or patterns (otherwise we wouldn't have the
problem we have with optimizing compilers). I couldn't, in good
conscience, tame KCSAN based on poorly thought-out rules. Because we
know they're data races, and the compiler _is_ free to subject them to
concurrency-unsafe optimizations.

Because we knew that different codes will want different KCSAN exposure
until there is a de-facto LKMM that is to be followed everywhere (one
can dream), KCSAN has lots of knobs. They are described in detail here:
https://lwn.net/Articles/816854/

While the data_race() macro was meant to be exactly for this case, to
tell tooling "this data race is fine, even if the compiler messes it
up", if there are too many data races for you right now feel free to add
'KCSAN_SANITIZE_file.o := n' to the files you don't want checked. Or
even 'KCSAN_SANITIZE := n' to ignore all files in a directory. It would
avoid the robots sending you reports. Not ideal, but it'd give some time
to see how things evolve elsewhere if you'd rather avoid all this for
now.

Thanks,
