was based on the critical health condition I find mine self. =C2=A0My names

disease and this illness has gotten to a very bad stage, I married my
husband for Ten years without a child. =C2=A0My husband died after a brief
illness that lasted for few  days.Since the death of my husband, I
decided not to remarry again, When my late husband was alive he
deposited the sum of =C2=A0($12.500.000 dollars.) with the Bank. Presently
this money is still in bank. And My  Doctor told me that I don't have
much time to live on this earth because my illness has gotten to a
very bad stage, Having known my condition I  decided to entrust over
the deposited fund under your custody to take care of the
less-privileged ones therein your country or position, which i believe
that you will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct
herein.

However all I need and required from you is your sincerity and ability
to carry out the transaction successfully and fulfill my final wish in
implementing the charitable project as it requires absolute trust and
devotion without any failure and I will be glad to see that the bank
finally release and transfer the fund into your bank account in your
country even before I die here in the hospital, because my present
health condition is very critical at the moment everything needs to be
process rapidly as soon as possible.
It will be my pleasure to compensate you as my Investment
Manager/Partner with 35 % percent of the total fund for your effort in
 handling the transaction, 5 % percent for any expenses or processing
charges fee that will involve during this process while 60% of the
fund will be Invested into the charity project there in your country
for the mutual benefit of the orphans and the less privileges ones.
Meanwhile I am waiting for your prompt respond, if only you are
interested for further details of the transaction and execution of
this  humanitarian project for the glory and honor of God the merciful
