Please don't send "checkpatch.pl --file" patches for the ext4 file
system; if you must, please focus on files in the drivers directory,
where they are more welcome.  If developers are making changes to a
file, fixing some checkpatch.pl whines is fine, but white-sapace only
changes just obfuscates "git blame" code archology, and so the costs
far outwieghs the costs.  "Fix" is also not the right verb to use.
For more information please see [1].

If you are looking for subtantive ways of contributing to the ext4
file system, feel free to look at various syzbot warnings[2] and try
to figure out what is going on there.

(In some cases, the syzbot complaint has already been fixed, and it's
just a matter of letting syzbot knoww that it has since been fixed by
a particular commit.  See [3] for more details.)
