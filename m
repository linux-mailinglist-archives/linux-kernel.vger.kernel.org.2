To optimize the page placement of a process between DRAM and PMEM, we
want to place the hot pages in DRAM and the cold pages in PMEM.  But the
memory accessing pattern changes overtime, so we need to migrate pages
between DRAM and PMEM to adapt to the changing.

To avoid the hot pages be pinned in PMEM always, one way is to online
the PMEM as movable zones.  If so, and if the low priority jobs are
restricted by cpuset to allocate from PMEM only, we may fail to run
quite some workloads as being discussed in the following threads,

Per my understanding, memory.low/min are for the memory protection
instead of the memory limiting.  memory.high is for the memory limiting.
