You don't have a choice - if there's no automation which verifies
whether all the CFI annotation needed is there, people won't know what
to wrap in what macro.

You don't have to - it is just an extern.

Oh, that I figured.

Looking at the changelog, DECLARE_ASM_FUNC_SYMBOL, makes a lot more
sense to me even if it doesn't specify the aspect that it is not called
by C but who cares - it is generic enough.

Maybe because wrapping some random symbols in a obfuscating macro to
make the next tool happy, is simply the wrong thing to do. I know, I
know, clang CFI needs it because of magical reason X but that doesn't
make it any better. Someday soon we'll have to write a tutorial for
people submitting kernel patches explaining what annotation to add where
and why.

Why can't clang be taught to ignore those symbols:

clang -fsanitize=cfi -fsanitize-cfi-ignore-symbols=<list>

?

Hmm, looking at https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.html

there *is* an ignore list:

"Ignorelist

A Sanitizer special case list can be used to relax CFI checks for
certain source files, functions and types using the src, fun and type
entity types. Specific CFI modes can be be specified using [section]
headers.

...

# Ignore all functions with names containing MyFooBar.
fun:*MyFooBar*
..."


So why aren't we doing that instead of those macros?
