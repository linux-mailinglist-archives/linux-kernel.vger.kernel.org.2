I don't get why low priority jobs can *not* use top tier memory? I can
think of it may incur latency overhead for high priority jobs. If it
is not allowed, it could be restricted by cpuset without introducing
in any new interfaces.

I'm supposed the memory utilization could be maximized by allowing all
jobs allocate memory from all applicable nodes, then let reclaimer (or
something new if needed) do the job to migrate the memory to proper
nodes by time. We could achieve some kind of balance between memory
utilization and resource isolation.

Look forward to reading it.
