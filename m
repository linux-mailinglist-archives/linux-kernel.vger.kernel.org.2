That would be great, however; when I implemented something similar, it 
resulted in a
lockdep splat between the lock used to protect the hook and the 
matrix_dev->lock used to
protect updates to matrix_mdev (including the freeing thereof). After 
pulling what little hair
I have left out, this seemed like a reasonable solution, over-engineered 
though it may be.
If somebody has a simpler solution, I'm all ears.
