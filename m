At first read, I found the description confusing (and even thought
that there was a copy/paste issue). The subject and the first sentence
is about "flexible arrays in a *union*". Then suddenly, the topic
shifts to *structs*.

After reading at the code, it is clear that this work for both:
  - unions with a flexible array.
  - structures with different typed trailing flexible arrays.

The subject and the description could be updated to clarify that this
macro can be used for both unions and structs.

N.B. this comment only applies to the commit message, the kerneldoc
part is clear.

It is entirely possible to have one or several flexible arrays in a
