Subject: [PATCH 1/4] perf vendor events: Syntax corrections in Neoverse N1 json
Date:   Mon,  4 Oct 2021 17:00:04 +0100
Message-Id: <20211004160008.21645-1-andrew.kilroy@arm.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.17.1
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

There are some syntactical mistakes in the json files for the Cortex A76
N1 (Neoverse N1).  This was obstructing parsing from an external tool.

This patch fixes the erroneous placement of commas causing the problems.
