We need strings to be able to be emitted and recorded in eBPF, perf and
ftrace. So I would rather go after a solution that lets us keep these in
the ring buffers, even if it means a perf hit.

Guess what's left is to where the best place to check is, checking in
the filter with unsafe flags would let us keep most of the perf (we just
check the undersize case, 1 branch). When these unsafe types are
filtered then a perf tax is imposed to keep things safe.

It sounded like Steven wanted to think about this a bit, so I'll wait a
bit before poking again for consensus :)

Do you have any strong feelings about where it goes?

Thanks,
