I don't think d) in itself is a valid requirement. How does it violate c)?

cpuset is already involved in NUMA allocation but it always felt like
something bolted on - it's weird to have cpu to NUMA node settings at global
level and then to have possibly conflicting direct NUMA configuration via
cpuset. My preference would be putting as much configuration as possible on
the mm / autonuma side and let cpuset's node confinements further restrict
their operations rather than cpuset having its own set of policy
configurations.

Johannes, what are your thoughts?

Thanks.
