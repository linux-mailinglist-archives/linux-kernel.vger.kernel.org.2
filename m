What I'd suggest is that we simply move

out of the thread function.  That means hanging struct mmpd_data off
the struct ext4_sb_info structure, and then adding a function like
this to fs/ext4/mmp.c

static void ext4_stop_mmpd(struct ext4_sb_info *sbi)
{
	if (sbi->s_mmp_tsk) {
		kthread_stop(sbi->s_mmp_tsk);
		brelse(sbi->s_mmp_data->bh);
		kfree(sbi->s_mmp_data);
		sbi->s_mmp_data = NULL;
		sbi->s_mmp_tsk = NULL;
	}
}

Basically, just move all of the cleanup so it is done after the
kthread is stopped, so we don't have to do any fancy error checking.
We just do it unconditionally.

P.S.  Actually, we could drop the struct mmpd_data altogether, and
just hang the buffer head as sbi->s_mmp_bh.  Then we can just pass the
struct super * as the private pointer to kmmpd().
