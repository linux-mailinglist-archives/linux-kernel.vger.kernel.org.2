As I mention in [1], I'm not sure about the exactly meaning of "broken" 
in unpoison_memory().

Maybe the misunderstanding is:

I think __get_hwpoison_page() mostly returns one for hwpoisoned page.
In 06be6ff3d2ec ("mm,hwpoison: rework soft offline for free pages"), 
page_handle_poison() is introduced, it will add refcount for all 
soft-offlineed hwpoison page.
In memory_failure() for hard-offlineï¼Œpage_ref_inc() called on free page 
too, and for used page, we do not call put_page() after 
get_hwpoison_page() != 0.
So all hwpoisoned page refcount must be great than zero when 
unpoison_memory() if regardless of racy.

Recently I tested loop soft-offline random pages and unpoison them for 
days, it works fine to me. (with bac9c6fa1f92 patched)
