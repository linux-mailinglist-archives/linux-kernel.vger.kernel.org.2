I really donâ€™t care much since that is for them and their company policy to figure out.

It is a total mess already for a dead simple patch like this. And they keep messing it up differently every time.

I provided a btusb_generate_qca_nvm_name() in one of my replies, where the variant variable was declared without NULL assignment and the ram_version was converted from little endian in place. That was 28th of September and 4 patches later the patch is still not ready to be merged. The maintainer hands you the recipe and you still screw up the cake multiple times; I am just done with this.

The next version would be a v16 btw. So seriously, how can we have 15 revisions so far and still not have this in a mergable state?

Regards

Marcel
