Ah, yes well... indeed, that could very well be the case. But that
is another change. It can surely help fix quite a bit of other odd
false positives.

I would prefer if such changes would go in separately.

If one sets the timeout to forever and if the module is already loaded
and we cannot remove it, I'd say its working as intended. But indeed,
fstests does not leave modules lingering around... it would be a user
error. I'll add a special case for this.

Good call, yeah that crap is not needed anymore. I'd still leave in
place the UDEV_SETTLE_PROG though, as I think that's good practice
and we can't loose anything. It can for instance salvage buggy
tests which forgot to use it.
