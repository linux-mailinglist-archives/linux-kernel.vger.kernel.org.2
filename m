Ok. So you're saying that we want to put both events on the queue
regardless, and put IRQ_HPD there first because we want to check the
status bit? Doesn't reading the status bit require the dongle to be
connected though? So if an unplug came in along with an irq_hpd we may
queue both the irq_hpd and the unplug, but when it comes time to process
the irq_hpd in the kthread the link will be gone and so trying the dpcd
read for the link status will fail?

I'm not insisting on anything. I'm just trying to think of various
corner cases that we're not handling in the code so we don't have to
worry about them in the future.
