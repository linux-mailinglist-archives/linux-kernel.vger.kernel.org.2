Interesting! So your CPU is down-clocking while performing (heavy) 
kernel work? Is that expected or are we mis-accounting kernel cpu time 
somehow when it comes to determining the CPU target frequency?

Again, very interesting finding.

Thanks for the insight, please do let me know when you learn more. x2 
slowdown still is quite a lot.
