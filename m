OK, let me check the v2.

Hm, why I suggested to use "# status" is that the comment will be
removed when writing it. So you can do

cat user_events > ~/saved_events
(reboot)
cat ~/saved_events > user_events

to restore events :)

I'm not sure this point, you mean 1 fd == 1 event model?

OK, let me check it.

__data_loc has the data offset field, which is the offset from the
entry of the recorded event on the ring buffer. Since there are
common fields, the offset is not the offset from user given buffer.
So it must be changed by kernel.
(Note that common fields expected to exist in all events, so that
user scripts can process the fields commonly)

In my idea, rel_loc is similar to the data_loc. It has the offset, but
the offset is the data offset from the rel_loc, not from the entry of
the recorded data. So kernel doesn't need to adjust it.
