I guess you mean MIPI DSI, and yes I agree, more generally it usually(!) 
doesn't make sense for any setup with fixed display panel.

On the other hand there are DSI/HDMI or DSI/DP adapters which usually 
have EDID reading logic.

And the concept makes sense for most connectors accepting external 
displays: HDMI, DP, MHL, VGA...

Usually there are two elements which are not the same:

1. HotPlug signal/wire.

2. EDID reading logic.

The logic responsible for reading EDID needs to be enabled only for time 
required for EDID reading :) So it's power state often must be 
controlled explicitly by the bridge driver. So even if in many cases 
pre_enable powers on the logic for EDID reading it does not make it the 
rule, so I must step back from my claim that it is up to caller :)

Ok, pre_enable should power on the chip, but for performing 
initialization of video transport layer. Assumption it will power on 
EDID logic is incorrect, so my claim seems wrong, but also this patch 
looks incorrect :)

In general only device containing EDID logic knows how to power it up.

Since I do not know your particular case I can propose few possible ways 
to investigate:

- call bridge.next->get_modes - you leave responsibility for powering up 
to the downstream device.

- ddc driver on i2c request should power up the panel - seems also correct,
