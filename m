This happens right now, I try to understand why exactly the current way is not
good in enough. :-)

Your approach makes sure that the MTD itself does not go away while it has users but
how does this help in the case where the underlying MFD just vanishes?
The MTD can be in use and the MFD can go away while e.g. mtd_read() or such
takes place.

Thanks,
