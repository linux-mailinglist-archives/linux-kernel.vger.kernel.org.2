Is there another kind of SVA? Our mapping from that each process requires a
single mm, and PASID for SVM was a direct map from that.

Not vIOMMU hot plug. but an application opens accel1, does a bind to
allocate a PASID. What i meant was kernel has no information if this needs
to be a per-RID PASID, or a global PASID. Keeping this global solves the
other problems or more complex mechanisms to say "Reserve this PASID on all
accelerators" which seems pretty complicated to implement.

Now are we loosing anything by keeping the PASIDs global? 

As we discussed there is no security issue since the PASID table that hosts 
these PASIDs for SVM are still per-RID.  For e.g.

app establishes connection to accl1, allocates PASID-X
   RID for accel1 now has PASID-X and the process mm plummed 
later app also connects with accl2, now the PASID-X is plummed in for RID
of accel2.

If one process has a single mm, is that also gross? :-) So a single process
having a PASID is just an identifier for IOMMU. It just seems like what a
mm is for a process == PASID for SVM-IOMMU support.

The unanswered question is how do we plumb from vIOMMU without a custom
allocator to get a system wide PASID? 

The way it works today is if we have a custom allocator registered, that's
the mechanics to get PASIDs allocated. for Intel vIOMMU it happens to be a
global unique allocation. If a particular vIOMMU doesn't require, it does
not have vIOMMU interface, and those naturally get a guest local PASID name
space. (Im not sure if that's how the allocator works today, but I guess its
extensible to accomplish a RID local PASID if that's exactly what is
required)

Cheers,
Ashok
