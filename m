That seems to be a valid concern, perhaps this needs a little more wider testing on
more platforms to really make sure it isn;t causing some regression.

That was by design to make sure rpmh does not ignore your request to 'turn off'
a resource (since it really does not allow clients to dictate when to turn off)
and keep it at the same level as before.
