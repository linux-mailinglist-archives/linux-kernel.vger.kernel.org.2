Yeah, I think it's useful to have a shared compatible for similar devices.

This is based on the MTP board, which does not specify a voltage. Do you=20
know what the correct voltage is here? I can find references to=20
3300000-3500000 uv but I don't know if that's correct. It seems to be=20
derived directly from the battery / power voltage, so this seems about=20
right.

Dropped.

Thanks for the review.
