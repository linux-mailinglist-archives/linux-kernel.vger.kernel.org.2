There is no duplicated kernel direct map in IOMMU.

This is what we are doing here. We allocate a supervisor PASID and put
the kernel page table (init_mm pgd) in this PASID entry.

Good idea. It makes things clear to the callers. They must only use direct
map memory for DMA.

DMA API would use RID2PASID (PASID 0), so it is separated by PASIDs.

Sorry, I am not following. This is used for direct map only.

Using SVA simplifies the work submission, there is no need to do map/unmap.
Just bind PASID with init_mm, then submit work directly either with ENQCMDS
(supervisor version of ENQCMD) to a shared workqueue or put the supervisor
PASID in the descriptor for dedicated workqueue.

We are doing the former case. There is no IOMMU page tables for the direct
map.
