That's right.

Physical connectors are already handled as bridges, see
drivers/gpu/drm/bridge/display-connector.c. I however don't think it
should handle EDID retrieval, because that's really not an operation
implemented by the connector itself.

I am, but too slowly. I don't mind fast-tracking the changes you need
though.
