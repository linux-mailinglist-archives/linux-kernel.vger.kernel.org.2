 From my channel: Bit's

Based on 30 years of IT Scene Data. Viking means Bay Dweller. Expression 
based on Creakstead River where I grew up. ('Unix' referring this 
river). Old name Åsgard, nearby also Åssiden. Drammen Central also 
Åspaviljongen.
Media ft. Indie styles that became Bit Streaming.
Author also was Worldclass Sound in local newspaper. - 
https://purplenoise.eu/Worldclass_Sound.png
Supports L'X, LCPU, Step Waver, and Fair Means Distribution. The recipe 
for Bit's can be licenced from us. - 4.86% alc/royalty. - believe in the 
nontrinitarian Sin, rather than the christian one. This is what I have 
called a Purple Noise project, that also is the label and web name.

Cheers,
Producer.
