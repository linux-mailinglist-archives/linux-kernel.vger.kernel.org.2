I do not see any bug reports coming in and I strongly suspect this is
because the functionality is simply not used wildly enough or in the
mode where it would matter (U != 0, K < U from our documentation).
If there are relevant usecases for this setup then we really want to
hear about those because we do not want to break userspace. Handling
that setup would far from trivial and the global oom killer is not the
only one of those.

I do not think your current approach is the right one. We do not really
want yet another flag to tell we are in a memcg OOM. We already have
one.

A proper way is to deal with the pagefault oom killer trigger but that
might be just too risky for stable kernels.
