I think SPDX identifier supplements license plate and is machine readable
identifier, but it does not replace or making adding of license plate
redundant.

- Quoting https://spdx.dev/ids/

  "When a license defines a recommended notice to attach to files under
  that license (sometimes called a “standard header”), the SPDX project
  recommends that the standard header be included in the files, in
  addition to an SPDX ID.

  Additionally, when a file already contains a standard header or other
  license notice, the SPDX project recommends that those existing
  notices should not be removed. The SPDX ID is recommended to be used
  to supplement, not replace, existing notices in files."

- GPL license text have section on "How to Apply These Terms to Your New
  Programs" which says to add license boilerplate text and it does not
  say SPDX identifier is enough.

- Also, page https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html
  does not forbid adding license plate text. (Even though it misguidedly
  says "alternative to boilerplate text" is the use of SPDX.)

- License text is a readable text and not just identifier.
  I think SPDX tag could be not legally binding in all jurisdictions.

By there reasons I believe you cannot request removing license platter
from the source and this should be author's decision.

Thanks,
