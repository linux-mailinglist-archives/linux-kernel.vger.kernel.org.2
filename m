Yes, sorry! I'll try to be more clear.

So, actually, IMO the concept doesn't make sense for anything with an
external connector. Here's the logic for a handful of connectors:

1. MIPI DSI: there is no EDID so this doesn't make sense.

2. An external connector (HDMI, DP, etc): the display that's plugged
in is externally powered so doesn't need us to power it up to read the
EDID. By definition, when the HPD signal is asserted then it's OK to
read the EDID and we don't even know if a display is plugged in until
HPD is asserted. Thus no special power sequencing is needed to read
the EDID.  (Yes, we need to make sure that the eDP controller itself
is powered, but that doesn't seem like it's the core's business).

3. eDP: this is where it matters. This is because:

3a) eDP displays aren't powered all the time. If you just boot up or
you blank your screen, likely the display has no power at all.

3b) Because the display has no power, the "HPD" signal doesn't assert.
In fact, for eDP the "HPD" signal really should mean "display ready"
or "display finished powering up".

3c) Even though we never get a HPD signal, we still simply assume that
a display is present because this is an "embedded" device.

So eDP is unique (as far as I know) in that it's a type of display
that has an EDID but that we will report "a display is here" before
we've powered up the display and before we can read the EDID.

OK, I'll plan to keep it in the bridge chip driver now.

I still believe my patch is correct. Specifically I don't need to make
any assumptions about display elements upstream of me (sources of the
bridge chip). I only need to make assumptions about the pre-enable of
the bridge driver itself and anything downstream of it.

At the moment downstream of this particular bridge chip is always a
panel device. Even further, all known downstream devices are
"simple-panel". That is known to power up the panel enough to read the
EDID in the "prepare" stage.

Sure, someone _could_ add another bridge downstream in some design,
but it would be up to that person to either fix that downstream driver
to power itself in pre-enable or to add some type of quirk disabling
the EDID reading.

The "next" bridge is the panel, so I don't think this works.

Right, so I could put the
"drm_bridge_chain_pre_enable(&pdata->bridge)" into the
ti_sn_aux_transfer() function. I talked about that a little bit "after
the cut" in my post where I said:

> - If everyone loves the "runtime PM" in the panel driver then we

>   transfer" function.

The reason for the dependence on "runtime PM" in the panel driver is
that we are doing DDC over AUX and it breaks the EDID reading into
lots of chunks so if we did the powering up and powering down there it
would be crazy slow without the delayed poweroff.
