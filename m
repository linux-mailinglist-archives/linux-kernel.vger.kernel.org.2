Right. EREMOVE on uninitialized pages does nothing, so a more reasonable way is to
just NOT call EREMOVE (your original code), since it is absolutely unnecessary.

I don't see ANY reason we should call EREMOVE here. 

Actually w/o my patch to split EREMOVE out of sgx_free_epc_page(), it then makes
perfect sense to have new sgx_free_epc_page() here.

It's not gone. It goes into a new sgx_encl_free_epc_page(), which is exactly the same
as current sgx_free_epc_page() which as EREMOVE, instead of putting EREMOVE into a
dedicated sgx_reset_epc_page(), as you did in your series:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-sgx/20210113233541.17669-1-jarkko@kernel.org/

However, your change has side effort: it always put page back into free pool, even
EREMOVE fails. To make your change w/o having any functional change, it has to be:

	if(!sgx_reset_epc_page())
		sgx_free_epc_page();

And for this, Dave raised one concern we should add a WARN() to let user know EPC
page is leaked, and reboot is requied to get them back.

However with sgx_reset_epc_page(), there's no place to add such WARN(), and
implementing original sgx_free_epc_page() as sgx_encl_free_epc_page() looks very
reasonable to me:
