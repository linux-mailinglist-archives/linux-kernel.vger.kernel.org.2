The counters that are diffs fit inside an s8 and they are kept limited
because their "true" value is sometimes critical -- e.g. NR_FREE_PAGES
for watermark checking. So the level of drift has to be controlled and
the drift should not exist potentially forever so it gets updated
periodically.

The inaccurate counters are only exported to userspace. There is no need
to update them every few seconds so fold_vm_zone_numa_events() is only
called when a user cares but you raise a raise a valid below.

The atomic is unnecessary for sure but using a local array is
problematic because of your next point.

That is a problem I missed. Even if zonestats was preserved on
hot-remove, fold_vm_zone_numa_events would not be reading the CPU so
hotplug events jump all over the place.

So some periodic folding is necessary. I would still prefer not to do it
by time but it could be done only on overflow or when a file like
/proc/vmstat is read. I'll think about it a bit more and see what I come
up with.

Thanks!
