Thanks for reviving my old patch! I still do think this is the right
direction. I would argue that we should split this into two stages as
already mentioned. First to add a bail out on fatal_signal_pending
because that is a trivial thing to do and it should be obviously safer.
Then we can remove out_of_memory completely. That should be obviously
right thing to do but if it turns out we have missed something we would
need to revert that part.

I am not sure the sha1 is the right one but the issue is there since
kmem accounting has been introduced so it should be around that time.
Maybe do not name the specific commit but stick to something like
"This has been broken since kmem accounting has been introduced for
cgroup v1 (3.8). There was no kmem specific reclaim for the separate
limit so the only way to handle kmem hard limit was to return with
ENOMEM."

I am still not sure this really needs a stable backport. There are no
bug reports for years so I strongly suspect people are simply not using
kmem hard limit with cgroup v1.

Btw. you should be adding your s-o-b here.
