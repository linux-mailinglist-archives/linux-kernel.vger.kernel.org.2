This patch keeps getting stuck for some reason.
It was sent several times already but always forgotten. :)

You made this change in some version already :)
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-msm/20210312003318.3273536-6-bjorn.andersson@linaro.org/

I think there was no real objection back then but more confusion about
how to get the squashed .mbn variant. Having it in linux-firmware would
certainly make it a lot easier overall if you can make that happen. :)

The latest version of this patch that I am aware of is the following one:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-msm/20210531224453.783218-1-bjorn.andersson@linaro.org/

As I wrote there it's mainly stuck on getting the related wcn36xx patch [1]
merged. Can you resend that one maybe?

Thanks,
Stephan
