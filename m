Here is an excerpt from the SIOV spec.
https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/download/intel-scalable-io-virtualization-technical-specification.html

"3.3 PASID translation
To support PASID isolation for Shared Work Queues used by VMs, the CPU must
provide a way for the PASID to be communicated to the device in the DMWr
transaction. On Intel CPUs, the CPU provides a PASID translation table in
the vCPUs virtual machine control structures. During ENQCMD/ENQCMDS
instruction execution in a VM, the PASID translation table is used by the
CPU to replace the guest PASID in the work descriptor with a host PASID
before the descriptor is sent to the device.3.3 PASID translation"

No, once a PASID is bound with IOMMU, KVM, and the mdev, work submission is
all done in HW.
But I don't think this will change for either uAPI design.

I guess we need to extend KVM interface to support PASIDs. Our original
intention was to avoid introducing new interfaces.

Can we? in case of exception. Since all these IOCTLs are coming from the
unreliable user space, we must deal all exceptions.

For example, when user closes /dev/ioasid FD before (or w/o) unbind IOCTL
for VFIO, KVM, kernel must do cleanup and coordinate among subsystems.
In this patchset, we have a per mm(ioasid_set) notifier to inform mdev, KVM
to clean up and drop its refcount. Do you have any suggestion on this?

OK. A separate IOCTL and separate step.

Let me try to paraphrase, you are suggesting common helper code and data
format but still driver specific storage of the mapping, correct?

Will try this out, seems cleaner.
