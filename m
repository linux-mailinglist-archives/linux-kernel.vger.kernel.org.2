Its been an issue for some 9 months now.  I really don't care how it 
gets fixed, but it seems to be past time for it to be fixed.

Sending simple little fixes on their own seems to accelerate the review 
process of those fixes, and doesn't hold them back if some "dependency" 
in a series has comments which need to be fixed.  It is a judgement call 
to determine if a set of fixes should be sent together or not, but I 
personally try to send individual patches when I can.
