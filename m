I am not sure to understand your message as answer to this thread.
There are two problems here:
1/ The DT values not being taken into account
2/ Kestrel's issue with two different integrations with no way to
distinguish between them.

1/ Has already been fixed (at least that is what I think)
2/ Cannot easily be fixed and I don't think there is anything we can do
besides the manufacturer "fixing" the board description.

Am I missing something?

Thanks,
Miqu√®l
