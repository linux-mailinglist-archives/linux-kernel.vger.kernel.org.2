Found an doc that talks about this, but then... how does the current 
Linux code work anyway for normal use cases?

That says dmb is not enough for DMA-control to DMA-data dependencies due 
to speculation, which is what we have here and the situation I described 
(with an IRQ along the way, but that's irrelevant). But that's what 
readl does: a read followed by a dmb(oshld) followed by a control 
dependency (but that needs an isb to take effect). How does this not 
break drivers that read DMA-accessed memory after a readl of a status 
register? I thought that was the point of the non-relaxed functions.
