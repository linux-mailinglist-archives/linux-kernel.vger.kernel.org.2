Right, I had that initially and changed it after a long indecision.  But
yeah, I've no strong opinion either way.

Agreed!

I'm not sure I understand your suggestion.  This is on the SETXATTR path,
so we'll need to block attempts to send this operation to the MDS.

An alternative would be to do this (return an error) on the MDS side, but
this would mean that we should also send the fscrypt fields to the MDS
because it may may not know yet that the inode is encrypted.  Which could
be the correct thing to do BTW.  Although I don't think client B could
concurrently change the layout of a directory that client A just set as
encrypted without client A sending that information to the MDS first...
