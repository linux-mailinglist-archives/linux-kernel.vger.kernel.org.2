Ah, I had written about scan/rescan in an earlier version of my email but
dropped it. I was actually going to suggest it being a sysfs attr, but I'm fine
with it being implicit so long as...

How do we assert that cxl_pci doesn't run before cxl_acpi has done anything? I
like the idea that the endpoint device can simply ask cxl_acpi to rescan, I just
don't see how it works. I suppose we can queue up the requests to rescan in
cxl_acpi if the ordering can't be guaranteed.

What is going to invoke the memdev driver's probe? That is where we're talking
about putting that is_cxl_dport(...) right? That is the part that tripped me up
and inspired the original email FWIW.

Okay.
