Subject: [PATCH v8 08/11] drm/bridge: ti-sn65dsi86: Promote the AUX channel to its own sub-dev

On its own, this change looks a little strange and doesn't do too much
useful. To understand why we're doing this we need to look forward to
future patches where we're going to probe our panel using the new DP
AUX bus. See the patch ("drm/bridge: ti-sn65dsi86: Add support for the
DP AUX bus").

Let's think about the set of steps we'll want to happen when we have
the DP AUX bus:

1. We'll create the DP AUX bus.
2. We'll populate the devices on the DP AUX bus (AKA our panel).
3. For setting up the bridge-related functions of ti-sn65dsi86 we'll
   need to get a reference to the panel.

If we do #1 - #3 in a single probe call things _mostly_ will work, but
it won't be massively robust. Let's explore.

First let's think of the easy case of no -EPROBE_DEFER. In that case
in step #2 when we populate the devices on the DP AUX bus it will
actually try probing the panel right away. Since the panel probe
doesn't defer then in step #3 we'll get a reference to the panel and
we're golden.

Second, let's think of the case when the panel returns
-EPROBE_DEFER. In that case step #2 won't synchronously create the
panel (it'll just add the device to the defer list to do it
later). Step #3 will fail to get the panel and the bridge sub-device
will return -EPROBE_DEFER. We'll depopulate the DP AUX bus. Later
we'll try the whole sequence again. Presumably the panel will
eventually stop returning -EPROBE_DEFER and we'll go back to the first
case where things were golden. So this case is OK too even if it's a
bit ugly that we have to keep creating / deleting the AUX bus over and
over.

So where is the problem? As I said, it's mostly about robustness. I
don't believe that step #2 (creating the sub-devices) is really
guaranteed to be synchronous. This is evidenced by the fact that it's
allowed to "succeed" by just sticking the device on the deferred
list. If anything about the process changes in Linux as a whole and
step #2 just kicks off the probe of the DP AUX endpoints (our panel)
in the background then we'd be in trouble because we might never get
the panel in step #3.

Adding an extra sub-device means we just don't need to worry about
it. We'll create the sub-device for the DP AUX bus and it won't go
away until the whole ti-sn65dsi86 driver goes away. If the bridge
sub-device defers (maybe because it can't find the panel) that won't
depopulate the DP AUX bus and so we don't need to worry about it.

NOTE: there's a little bit of a trick here. Though the AUX channel can
run without the MIPI-to-eDP bits of the code, the MIPI-to-eDP bits
can't run without the AUX channel. We could come up a complicated
signaling scheme (have the MIPI-to-eDP bits return EPROBE_DEFER for a
while or wait on some sort of completion), but it seems simple enough
to just not even bother creating the bridge device until the AUX
channel probes. That's what we'll do.

(no changes since v7)

Changes in v7:
- Beefed up commit message in context of the DP AUX bus.
- Remove use of now-dropped drm_dp_aux_register_ddc() call.
- Set the proper sub-device "dev" pointer in the AUX structure.

Changes in v6:
- Use new drm_dp_aux_register_ddc() calls.
