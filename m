Both, actually... but sincerely I would be more for updating the DSI PHY
drivers instead of keeping a "mock" crystal clock in there (since we do
always specify one in DT), also because, as Marijn pointed out and as I
can also confirm, we're seeing the same situation on multiple platforms.

That would allow us to solve the issue simply with DT, and would make us
able to switch platforms one by one to the RPM/RPMh XO in a perfect future
where we will be able to perform XO shutdown on selected platforms.

Totally fair and I totally agree.
