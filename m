Fair enough. How about something along the lines of:
"At least some of the CPUs integrated in the Apple M1 SoC have
  the terrible habit..."

This is my hunch as well. And if they did, it shouldn't be a big deal:
the "architecture compliant" CPUs would simply transition via EL1
as expected, and join their buggy friends running at EL2 slightly later.

Thanks,

         M.
