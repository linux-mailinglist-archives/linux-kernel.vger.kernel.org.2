Yes, I understand you are now trying to add/scale for a board compatible and
your patch is what triggered the warnings.

I see "ti,j721e" as an SoC compatible not board-specific.

You can go back and look at my original dt-binding submissions and the reasons
for me to add a root-cell. They are to suppress the warnings seen with using two
address-cells in the DSP example nodes which use the actual node definitions
from the J721E SoC.

One other way would have been to just add the new enforced compatible (since you
are actually changing the k3.yaml binding and diverging from what was there
before) here along with your updates, if you didn't want to add it in the
previous compatible way.

FWIW, there are no dt_binding_check errors on this binding before your
modifications, that's why I am asking what is the "Fixes" with the original patch.

Yeah finally. I remember I had asked you about why we are doing it differently
between AM65x and J721E/J7200. +1 for the direction.

I am not saying it should be tied to a platform, but I have used the example as
it appears on J721E SoCs. I am commenting that it is not a "Fixes:" and the
patch description needs updates.

Please see the reasoning in the original submissions. I could not use 2
address-cells and size-cells without the top-level node additions, and I didn't
want to use bogus examples.

Yes, the intricate solution would not have triggered the warning in this
example, but your current change is also breaking your previous compatibility. I
understand that the reality is always actually a "board-compatible",
"soc-compatible", but as per your previous k3.yaml definition, all one needed
was just a "ti,j721e" compatible in their dts files. Changing it now and calling
the usage in this example "wrong" is not right either IMO.

I would rather not use a completely bogus example since it is not very useful
for customers trying to understand the binding. My philosophy has always been to
define an example as it appears on an actual SoC so that it is easier for
customers to comprehend the binding and example while comparing it to actual dts
nodes.
