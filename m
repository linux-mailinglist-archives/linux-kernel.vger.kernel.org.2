Let's make sure we get your point correctly. I think we have discussed
this in the past, but let's refresh our memories.

If I recall correctly, you are against the mmc pwrseq DT bindings
because we are using a separate pwrseq OF node, that we point to via a
"mmc-pwrseq" property that contains a phandle from the mmc controller
device node. Is that correct?

If we would have encoded the power sequence specific properties, from
within a child node for the mmc controller node, that would have been
okay for you, right?

That's what Peter Chen was trying to do. A generic interface, flexible
enough so it can be used for many similar configurations (but not
exactly the same).

Perhaps it was too generic though.

The requirements are certainly per device, but the way to manage them
doesn't have to be.

As you said above, a generic library that subsystems/drivers can call
to power on/off a discoverable device, before trying to probe it would
be a good start.

A child OF node?

Then what do you think about some common power sequence properties
that we can use in such node?
