I agree with that this should be in core!
But changing the exiting behavior of the apis is the one am against!
For example if we are reading a fixed size UUID or some cell like that 
we would want to validate it, allowing flexible sizes would not catch 
errors.
Also if its variable size then which apis should consumer use, should he 
use u32 or u16 based, this adds more confusion to this!

This should be perfectly okay!
may be something like:

int nvmem_read_variable_cell(struct device *dev, const char *cell_id, 
void *buf, size_t sz_min, size_t sz_max);

It should return number of bytes it read and fail if cell size is less 
then sz_min!
