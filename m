Well, it's not harmless; because it occurs at start of day, it means we
clear the ineffective command and use default values and those happen
to work fine for the TPM in question, so the problem is pretty much
covered up.  If it had occurred anywhere else it would result in a loss
of the command data with unknown ramifications to user space, possibly
leading to a TPM failure.

Hopefully this means this is the only place we screwed up, but you can
see why a scary warning and stack trace is appropriate: if it triggers,
something in the kernel violated the TPM command model.
