I posted a patchset a while ago to do something very similar, but that
got stalled for some reason and I unfortunately didn't follow it up:

 https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200825153338.17061-1-vincent.whitchurch@axis.com/

A key difference between that patchset and this patch (besides that
small fact that I used +x instead of +T) was that my patchset allowed
the dyndbg trace to be emitted to the main buffer and did not force them
to be in an instance-specific buffer.

That feature is quite important at least for my use case since I often
use dyndbg combined with function tracing, and the latter doesn't work
on non-main instances according to Documentation/trace/ftrace.rst.

For example, here's a random example of a bootargs from one of my recent
debugging sessions:

 trace_event=printk:* ftrace_filter=_mmc*,mmc*,sd*,dw_mci*,mci*
 ftrace=function trace_buf_size=20M dyndbg="file drivers/mmc/* +x"
