Sure, I will get the numbers for both cases(inline and indirect calls) 
and run some
benchmark tests with register tracing enabled for both cases.

But how is this different from logic in atomic-instrumented.h which also 
has asm-generic version?
Initial review few years back mentioned about having something similar 
to atomic instrumentation
and hence it was implemented with the similar approach keeping 
instrumentation out of arch specific
details.
And if we do move this instrumentation to asm-generic/io.h, how will 
that be executed since
the arch specifc read{b,w,l,q} overrides this generic version?

Thanks,
Sai
