Booting with init=/bin/sh and running that grep command right away at
the prompt:

With the xa_store_range() call commented out of my kernel:

radix_tree_node     9800   9968    584   56    8 : tunables    0    0    0 : slabdata    178    178      0


With xa_store_range() enabled:

radix_tree_node     9950  10136    584   56    8 : tunables    0    0    0 : slabdata    181    181      0



The head of the file says these are the field names:

# name            <active_objs> <num_objs> <objsize> <objperslab> <pagesperslab> : tunables <limit> <batchcount> <sharedfactor> : slabdata <active_slabs> <num_slabs> <sharedavail>

So I think this means that I have (9950 - 9800) * 584 = 87600 more bytes
allocated. Maybe that's a lot? But percentage-wise is seems in the
noise. E.g. We allocate one "struct sgx_epc_page" for each SGX page.
On my system I have 4GB of SGX EPC, so around 32 MB of these structures.
