I'm good with the changes made to the above two patches.

Here I'm assuming the enable and disable calls you are referring to are
cscfg_csdev_enable_active_config() and cscfg_csdev_disable_active_config().

From the above paragraph I understand that a call to cscfg_csdev_enable_config()
can be interrupted at any time when the CPU is shutting down, which can only
happen when operating from sysfs.

With the above in mind and looking at the implementation in patch 05, if the
code gets interrupted right after cscfg_csdev_enable_config(), function
cscfg_csdev_disable_config() in cscfg_csdev_disable_active_config() won't be
called.

In function cscfg_csdev_enable_active_config(), could it be possible to set
csdev->active_cscfg_ctxt instead of csdev->cscfg_in_enable?  If
cscfg_csdev_enable_config() gets interrupted then function
cscfg_csdev_disable_config() can be called.  At that point disabling a feature
that hasn't been enabled shouldn't do anything. 

Thanks,
Mathieu
