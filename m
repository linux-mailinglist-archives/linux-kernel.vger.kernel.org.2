Queued and pushed as shown below.  Nice diffstat!  ;-)

commit c47687cb4cd09422c93a1a7dd7562e10439861b6

    kvfree_rcu: Refactor kfree_rcu_monitor()
    
    Currently we have three functions which depend on each other.
    Two of them are quite tiny and the last one where the most
    work is done. All of them are related to queuing RCU batches
    to reclaim objects after a GP.
    
    1. kfree_rcu_monitor(). It consist of few lines. It acquires a spin-lock
       and calls kfree_rcu_drain_unlock().
    
    2. kfree_rcu_drain_unlock(). It also consists of few lines of code. It
       calls queue_kfree_rcu_work() to queue the batch.  If this fails,
       it rearms the monitor work to try again later.
    
    3. queue_kfree_rcu_work(). This provides the bulk of the functionality,
       attempting to start a new batch to free objects after a GP.
    
    Since there are no external users of functions [2] and [3], both
    can eliminated by moving all logic directly into [1], which both
    shrinks and simplifies the code.
    
    Also replace comments which start with "/*" to "//" format to make it
    unified across the file.
