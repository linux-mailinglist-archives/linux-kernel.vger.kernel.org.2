Yes, it is true that this problem could affect other drivers.  ...and
in full disclosure I think there are other similar workarounds already
present. I haven't personally worked on those chips, but in
ps8640_bridge_get_edid() there is a somewhat similar workaround to
chain a pre-enable (though maybe it's not quite as optimized?). I'm
told that maybe something had to be handled for anx7625 (in
anx7625_get_edid()?) but that definitely doesn't look at all like it's
doing a pre-enable, so maybe things for that bridge just work
differently.

One thing that makes me hesitant about trying to moving this to the
core is that even in sn65dsi86 there is a case where it won't work. As
I mentioned in the patch I'm not aware of anyone using it in
production, but if someone was using the MIPI clock as input to the
bridge chip instead of a fixed "refclk" then trying to get the EDID
after just "pre-enable" falls over.  Said another way: I can say that
with this particular bridge chip, if you're using a fixed refclk, you
can read the EDID after the pre-enable. I don't know if that's always
true with all other bridge chips.

So I guess in summary: I think I could put my code in the core, but I
don't _think_ I can just make it automatically enabled.

* In sn65dsi I'd have to only enable it if we have a fixed refclk.

* Maybe in ps8640 I could just always enable it and replace the
existing code? I'd have to find someone to test.

* In anx7625 things look totally different.

Can you give me any advice on how you'd like me to proceed?
