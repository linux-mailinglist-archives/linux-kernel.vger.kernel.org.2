I want to point out that this solves a  couple of other problems also.  
Currently virtiofsd attempts to write security attributes on the host, 
which is denied by default on systems without SELinux and no 
CAP_SYS_ADMIN.  This means if you want to run a container or VM on a 
host without SELinux support but the VM has SELinux enabled, then 
virtiofsd needs CAP_SYS_ADMIN.  It would be much more secure if it only 
needed CAP_SYS_RESOURCE.  If the host has SELinux enabled then it can 
run without CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RESOURCE, but it will only be 
allowed to write labels that the host system understands, any label not 
understood will be blocked. Not only this, but the label that is running 
virtiofsd pretty much has to run as unconfined, since it could be 
writing any SELinux label.

If virtiofsd is writing Userxattrs with CAP_SYS_RESOURCE, then we can 
run with a confined SELinux label only allowing it to sexattr on the 
content in the designated directory, make the container/vm much more secure.
