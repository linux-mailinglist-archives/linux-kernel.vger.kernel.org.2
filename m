Hi,

The patch subject should be,

"bus: mhi: Wait for M2 state during system resume"

We follow "bus: mhi:" prefix for all MHI patches. Also, the subject should
clearly portray what the patch is intend to do.

s/notify/notifies and s/mhi dirver/MHI host. MHI driver is somewhat confusing
since we have the MHI device driver (QRTR etc...) as well. So just use MHI host
everywhere.

Could you please add a fixes tag as well? And this patch should be backported to
stable kernels also, so please CC stable@vger.kernel.org.

Thanks,
