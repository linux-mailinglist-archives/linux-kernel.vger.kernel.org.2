Seems like we have different use cases: traditional debugging, and
in-production flight recorder for problem reporting. I'm not surprised
if they need different treatment.

If the DRM tracing goes into the main buffer, then systems in
production cannot have any other sub-system traced in a similar
fashion. To me it would feel very arrogant to say that to make use of
DRM flight recording, you cannot trace much or anything else.

The very purpose of the flight recorder is run in production all the
time, not in a special debugging session.

There is also the question of access and contents of the trace buffer.
Ultimately, if automatic bug reports are enabled in a system, the
contents of the trace buffer would be sent as-is to some bug tracking
system. If there is a chance to put non-DRM stuff in the trace buffer,
that could be a security problem.

My use case is Weston. When Weston encounters an unexpected problem in
production, something should automatically capture the DRM flight
recorder contents and save it alongside the Weston log. Would be really
nice if Weston itself could do that, but I suspect it is going to need
root privileges so it needs some helper daemon.

Maybe Sean can reiterate their use case more?
