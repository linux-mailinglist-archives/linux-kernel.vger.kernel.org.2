Hmm actually I think your approach should work, i.e. have

  config PREEMPT_DYNAMIC
    depends on [...] && !PREEMPT_RT

rather than

  config PREEMPT_RT
    depends on [...] && !PREEMPT_DYNAMIC

This essentially gives priority to the preemption model type over the
preemption model dynamicness, which I think makes sense. I can fold that in
v2.
