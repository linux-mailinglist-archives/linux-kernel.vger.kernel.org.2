Sorry I don't get it. Does pmic_arb_read_cmd() no longer do any locking
after this change? I was thinking there would be=20

	pmic_arb_read_cmd_unlocked()

	pmic_arb_read_cmd()
	 take lock
	 pmic_arb_read_cmd_unlocked()
	 release lock

        pmic_arb_write_cmd_unlocked()

	pmic_arb_write_cmd()
	 take lock
	 pmic_arb_write_cmd_unlocked()
	 release lock

	pmic_arb_read_modify_write()
	 take lock
	 pmic_arb_read_cmd_unlocked()
	 do bit twiddle
	 pmic_arb_write_cmd_unlocked()
	 release lock

but if the formatting is intensive then it could also be extracted to
another function

	pmic_arb_fmt_read_cmd()

	pmic_arb_read_cmd_unlocked()

	pmic_arb_read_cmd()
	 pmic_arb_fmt_read_cmd()
	 take lock
	 pmic_arb_read_cmd_unlocked()
	 release lock

	pmic_arb_fmt_write_cmd()

        pmic_arb_write_cmd_unlocked()

	pmic_arb_write_cmd()
	 pmic_arb_fmt_write_cmd()
	 take lock
	 pmic_arb_write_cmd_unlocked()
	 release lock

	pmic_arb_read_modify_write()
	 r =3D pmic_arb_fmt_read_cmd()
	 w =3D pmic_arb_fmt_write_cmd()
	 take lock
	 pmic_arb_read_cmd_unlocked(r)
	 r &=3D w
	 pmic_arb_write_cmd_unlocked(w)
	 release lock

It would probably become a huge patch which isn't great, but it would
focus the critical section to the thing that actually matters. This is
irq code so maybe we should write it in a way that keeps the spinlock as
tight as possible. It looks like the current spinlock is placed tightly
for this purpose, but then we use function pointers to format the
message and wait, which isn't good for straight line code.
