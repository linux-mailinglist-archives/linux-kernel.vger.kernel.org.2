If you are concerned about such a case, we can add an excess threshold,
say 4 MB (or 1024 4K pages), before we trigger a forced update. You think
that will cover this concern?

I actually have tried adjusting the threshold but found that it doesn't work well for
the case with unenven memory access frequency between cgroups.  The soft
limit for the low memory event cgroup could creep up quite a lot, exceeding
the soft limit by hundreds of MB, even
if I drop the SOFTLIMIT_EVENTS_TARGET from 1024 to something like 8.
