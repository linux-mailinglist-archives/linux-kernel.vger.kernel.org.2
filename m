Hi Jian,

Drop "a config".

                 ^ I would drop "or" here
                                                  ^ drop comma,
                                                    use "and",
                                                    typo: "Meltdown"

Although, is that a fair statement? SLS is not called Spectre or
Meltdown by ARM, it is a speculative processor vulnerabilty. It
might just be better to drop eerything after the first comma (although
maybe that is just being pedantic).

I cannot comment on whether or not this is worth doing, I will leave
that up to Will, Catalin, et al. The following comments are more from a
"regular kernel developer" perspective, rather than an "arm64 kernel
developer" :)

This is also a useful article it seems:

I do not think that CONFIG_CC_HAS_HARDEN_SLS_ALL serves much purpose.
Moving the cc-option into CONFIG_HARDEN_SLS_ALL is just as clean.

config HARDEN_SLS_ALL
	bool "enable SLS vulnerability hardening"
	depends on $(cc-option,-mharden-sls=all)
	help
	  Enables straight-line speculation vulnerability hardening
	  at highest level.

The spacing here seems messed up, I corrected it above.
