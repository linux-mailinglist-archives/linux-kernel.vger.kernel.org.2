And of course, I forgot to say what the above is doing :-p

I wanted to see how long syscalls block for. So I created a synthetic
event that connects with the starting of all system calls, with the
exit of the same system call, using the common_pid of the task as the
key to connect the two.

I record the id of the system call as well as the latency that is
recorded, and send that off to a synthetic event called "syscall_wait".

The '-e' option of the man page program sqlhist executes the command to
create the synthetic event.

Then I add a histogram to that event keying off the id (the ".syscall"
writes out the name of the system call along with the id), and the
latency "lat" grouping it in buckets of "5 microseconds", and sort it
by the latency.

I waited a while, and then reported the result.

When I first ran this, the system calls that block for a long time
filled up the histogram with useless data.  Those were the various
"poll" and "select" as well as (surprising) "futex" system call.
