This is what we discussed during a meeting we had on the rpsmg_tty subject the
July 7, 2020. [1] sump-up what you requested from me before introducing the
rpmsg tty. But we miss-understood your requirement?

This work is the result of our discussion:
- decorrelate the control and stream part of the rpmsg_char to be able to reuse
the control for other rpmsg services such as the rpmsg_tty.
- Add capability to instantiate other rpmsg service from Linux user land
applications.

The correlation between the rpmsg_char and the rpmsg_ctrl is due to the support
of the RPMSG_CREATE_EPT_IOCTL RPMSG_DESTROY_EPT_IOCTL legacy controls for the
QCOM driver.

At the end I guess the rpmsg_ctrl could become, in the future, a channel for
endpoint signaling between processors.

Similar to what it is done with the RPMSG_CREATE_EPT_IOCTL but based on the
channel not the endpoint (as the rpmsg_bus virtio is channel based).

For instance we received several issue reports from customer on rpmsg
communication. The reason was that the coprocessor creates an unidirectional
channel to transfer data to the main processor. But nothing works because the
coprocessor doesn't have the remote address until the main processor send a
first message. The workaround is to send a fake message from the Linux to
provide is ept address.
Making this in the other direction allows the Linux application to initiate such
link when it is ready to receive data.

Other examples of usage:
- Create a temporary channel to get for instance logs of the remotre proc
- destroy and re-create some channels on Linux suspend/resume.

As the proposal of exposing the capability to userland to initiate the link (if
i well remember) is coming from you, don't hesitate if you have some extra
uscase that i can add in the cover letter.

Please tell me if I wrong, but the bind /unbind allows to probe/remove an
exiting device. the RPMSG_CREATE_DEV_IOCTL creates a new one on the rpmsg bus,
so not exactly the same use case.
