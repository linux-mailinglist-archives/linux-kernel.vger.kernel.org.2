Might have to set fully spanned section online. (vmemmap >= SECTION_SIZE)

Something else to note:


We'll not call the memory notifier (e.g., MEM_ONLINE) for the vmemmap. 
The result is that

1. We won't allocate extended struct pages for the range. Don't think 
this is really problematic (pages are never allocated/freed, so I guess 
we don't care - like ZONE_DEVICE code).

2. We won't allocate kasan shadow memory. We most probably have to do it 
explicitly via kasan_add_zero_shadow()/kasan_remove_zero_shadow(), see 
mm/memremap.c:pagemap_range()


Further a locking rework might be necessary. We hold the device hotplug 
lock, but not the memory hotplug lock. E.g., for get_online_mems(). 
Might have to move that out online_pages.
