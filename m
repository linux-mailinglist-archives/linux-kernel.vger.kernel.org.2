Having been through quite some data now, 100 videos, and a 2.5 hr DJ 
set, (https://soundcloud.com/rdm_show) it seems what happened at the end 
of the 90s is mainstream usage, and cracked software (KvR).

Seems that is the situation that still needs to work. € seems good for a 
netcurrency, and trying to set things up, so this works fairly in 
reasonable contexts.

That seems to be perfecting the J X (avsource nix, with a translated 
quranic background for Fair IT).

Serenity,
