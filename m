A trap is noreturn by definition:

 -- Built-in Function: void __builtin_trap (void)
     This function causes the program to exit abnormally.

The DWARF debug info should be sufficient.  Perhaps you can post-process
some way?

You can create a trap that falls through yourself (by having a trap-on
condition with a condition that is always true, but make the compiler
not see that).  This isn't efficient though.

Could you file a feature request (in bugzilla)?  It is probably useful
for generic code as well, but we could implement this for powerpc only
if needed.
