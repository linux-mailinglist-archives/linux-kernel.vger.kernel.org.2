Hi, this is your Linux kernel regression tracker speaking again.

This thread once again looks stalled and smells a lot like "everyone
agrees that his should be fixed, but afaics nobody submitted a fix or
committed to work on one". Please speak up if my impression is wrong, as
this is a regression and thus needs to be fixed, ideally quickly. Part
of my job is to make that happen and thus remind developers and
maintainers about this until we have a fix.

Ciao, Thorsten
