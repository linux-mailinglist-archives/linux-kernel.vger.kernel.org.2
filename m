Not sure what value such an option would have, and how it would be used.
I would argue that randconfig should not set COMPILE_TEST to start with,
since its purpose should be to test random valid configurations and not
to compile test arbitrary (and in that case random) code. But that is
a different question, and just my personal opinion.

Overall, the question is what kind of additional option you would find
useful for s390. You make it clear that you don't want COMPILE_TEST.
At the same time, you still want all{mod,yes}config, but presumably
excluding options currently restricted by !COMPILE_TEST (such as
DEBUG_INFO, BPF_PRELOAD, UBSAN_TRAP, GCC_PLUGIN_CYC_COMPLEXITY,
and a few others). SUPPRESS_NOISY_TESTS would not cover that, but
neither would RANDCONFIG (or whatever it would be called).
