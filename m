If these are "user defined" then perhaps we add a wrapper to the filtering
that is called instead of the normal filtering for theses events that
verify the fields of the events being filtered are located on the ring
buffer. Although, strings and such are rare or just slow in filtering that
we could make sure the content is still on the buffer that is being
filtered.

Yes, it's the fact that the code is created in the kernel, and the only way
that the filtering could be out of bounds is if there's a bug in the
kernel. We rather not check for that if it slows down the tracing. But
perhaps if we can show that the checks are only done for dynamic strings
and arrays, that it doesn't cause noticeable overhead, it may be fine to
keep for all events.
