Subject: [PATCH V10 0/8] Add QSPI and QUPv3 DT nodes for SC7280 SoC
Date:   Thu, 23 Sep 2021 17:46:10 +0530
Message-Id: <1632399378-12229-1-git-send-email-rajpat@codeaurora.org>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.7.4
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Changes in V10:
 - As per Stephen's comments, Removed <&qup_spiN_cs_gpio> in all spi ports.
 - Added "&qupv3_id_1" in sc7280-idp.dtsi file  because EC and TPM
   are using "qupv3_id_1" node.

Changes in V9:
 - As per Stephen's comments,
   1. Moved back qup_opp_table from /soc@0/geniqup@9c0000 to /
   2. changed node names to "qup_spi0_cs_gpio: qup-spi0-cs-gpio" because
      node names should have dashes instead of underscores.

Changes in V8:
 - As per Matthias comments
   Added back qup_spiN_cs_gpio nodes in all spi ports

 - As per Doug comments, Added "qcom,sc7280-qspi" compatible in qspi node

Changes in V7:
 - As per Stephen's comments
   1. Moved qup_opp_table under /soc@0/geniqup@9c0000
   2. Removed qupv3_id_1 in sc7280-idp board file
   3. Sorted alias names for i2c and spi as per alphabet order

 - As per Matthias comment
   Configuring cs pin with gpio (qup_spiN_cs_gpio) definitions are removed

Changes in V6:
 - As per Matthias' comments,
   1. Squashed "Update QUPv3 UART5 DT node" and "Configure debug
      uart for sc7280-idp"
   2. Moved qup_opp_table from /soc to /
   3. Changed convention "clocks" followed by "clock-names"

 - As per Doug comments, added aliases for i2c and spi

Changes in V5:
 - As per Matthias' comments, I've split the patches as below:
   1. Add QSPI node
   2. Configure SPI-NOR FLASH for sc7280-idp
   3. Add QUPv3 wrapper_0 nodes
   4. Update QUPv3 UART5 DT node
   5. Configure debug uart for sc7280-idp
   6. Configure uart7 to support bluetooth on sc7280-idp
   7. Add QUPv3 wrapper_1 nodes

Changes in V4:
 - As per Stephen's comment updated spi-max-frequency to 37.5MHz, moved
   qspi_opp_table from /soc to / (root).
 - As per Bjorn's comment, added QUP Wrapper_0 nodes
   as separate patch and debug-uart node as separate patch.
 - Dropped interconnect votes for wrapper_0 and wrapper_1 node
 - Corrected QUP Wrapper_1 SE node's pin control functions like below
        QUP Wrapper_0: SE0-SE7 uses qup00 - qup07 pin-cntrl functions.
        QUP Wrapper_1: SE0-SE7 uses qup10 - qup17 pin-cntrl functions.

Changes in V3:
 - Broken the huge V2 patch into 3 smaller patches.
   1. QSPI DT nodes
   2. QUP wrapper_0 DT nodes
   3. QUP wrapper_1 DT nodes

Changes in V2:
 - As per Doug's comments removed pinmux/pinconf subnodes.
 - As per Doug's comments split of SPI, UART nodes has been done.
 - Moved QSPI node before aps_smmu as per the order.
