I am a bit surprised that you could not reproduce on SkylakeX, as the 
metric expressions are the same.

As an experiment I hacked the mapfile.csv to make my broadwell machine 
pick up the skylakex pmu-events:

diff --git a/tools/perf/pmu-events/arch/x86/mapfile.csv

The events in group usually have to be from the same PMU. Try 
reorganizing the group.

As I said, one issue is caused by me, and I can send a fix. I need to 
test more, though. And I was holding off until an approach decided for 
2nd issue. Since no resolution yet, I think I'll just send a fix today.

Thanks,
John
