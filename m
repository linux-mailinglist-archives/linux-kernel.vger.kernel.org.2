Do you mean a compatible string?

May be that could be needed in the future. No objection to rename it to
'powerzones'.

Ok

I was unsure about adding it. With the actual description what would be
the benefit ?

Yes it is

Ok, makes sense

Ok, may be 'powerzone-pkg' to be consistent with the power-domains pattern?

I'm not sure 'provider' or 'consumer' make sense in this context.

big@0 is a powerzone we can act on and its parent is the BIG_PZ powerzone.

However this description is correct but confusing.

Given big@0 and big@1 belong to the big 'cluster' and when we act on the
performance state of big@0, big@1 is also changed, the correct
description would be:

    A57_0: big@0 {
      compatible = "arm,cortex-a57";
      reg = <0x0 0x0>;
      device_type = "cpu";
      #powerzone-cells = <0>;
      powerzone = <&PKG_PZ>;
    };

    A57_1: big@1 {
      compatible = "arm,cortex-a57";
      reg = <0x0 0x0>;
      device_type = "cpu";
      #powerzone-cells = <0>;
      powerzone = <&PKG_PZ>;
    };

If in the future, there will be a performance domain per core, then the
former description above would make sense.
