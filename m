While we're not yet there to test that out on A6xx-equipped platforms,

my experience with lack ofAdreno firmware so far has been like so:


no ZAP, wrong ZAP address in the DT, bad ZAP - either a lockup or a reboot


no pm4/pfp - mostly a sane failing route with GPU just not activating after all,

yet still I can recall having some problems that I probably won't be able to

reproduce right now


no GMU fw - as stated before, can't really test properly just yet
