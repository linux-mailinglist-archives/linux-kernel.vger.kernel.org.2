It would be still great to invest into those improvements. And I would
be really grateful to learn about bottlenecks from the existing kernel
interfaces you have found on the way.

I cannot imagine any OOM handler to be reliable if it has to depend on
other userspace component with a lower resource priority. OOM handlers
are fundamentally complex components which has to reduce their
dependencies to the bare minimum.

OK, thanks for clarification. There will certainly be hard problems to
sort out[1] but the overall idea makes sense to me and it sounds like a
much better approach than a OOM specific solution.


[1] - how the pool is going to be replenished without hitting all
potential reclaim problems (thus dependencies on other all tasks
directly/indirectly) yet to not rely on any background workers to do
that on the task behalf without a proper accounting etc...
