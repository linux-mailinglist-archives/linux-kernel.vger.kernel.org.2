So indeed with these patches I end up in the situation where we if
if spawn two ltp zram02.sh runs and cancel then randomly and start
them again:

zram: Can't change algorithm for initialized device

And after that only if you do:

swapoff /dev/zram0

Only then can you restart the tests again.

I had note seen that with my patch fix, but But Ming noted that he
did see that, and I trust him, although I can't reproduce that issue.

And from at lest a testing perspective then:

Tested-by: Luis Chamberlain <mcgrof@kernel.org>

I'll go and do the line-by-line code review now.

  Luis
