Then the comment just above this check should be adjusted. It states:
/*
 * If we (unlikely) can't read this register, to prevent hardware
 * damage at all costs, we assume that the overcurrent event was
 * real; Moreover, if the status register is not signaling OCP,
 * it was a spurious event, so it's all ok.
 */

The " if the status register is not signaling OCP, it was a spurious
event, so it's all ok." is incredibly misleading. That comment combined
with comment above qcom_labibb_check_ocp_status()

 * This function checks the STATUS1 register for the VREG_OK bit: if it
is
 * set, then there is no Over-Current event.
 *
 * Returns: Zero if there is no over-current, 1 if in over-current or
 *          negative number for error

made me to _assume_ that when qcom_labibb_check_ocp_status returns zero
we have spurious event - for which just returning the IRQ_NONE should
be perfectly sane thing to do.

As I said, I don't have the HW or specifications or expertise with this
IC. If this was not spurious event then I don't know what is the right
thing to do. I am just shooting this blindly. Feel free to take over
this fix and also adjust the comments so that they match the HW
behaviour :)

Best Regards
