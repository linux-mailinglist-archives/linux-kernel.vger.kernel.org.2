The sceanrio I saw was we have multiple cgroups running pmbench.
One cgroup exceeded the soft limit and soft reclaim is active on
that cgroup.  So there are a whole bunch of memcg events associated
with that cgroup.  Then another cgroup starts to exceed its
soft limit.  

Memory is accessed at a much lower frequency
for the second cgroup.  The memcg event update was not triggered for the
second cgroup as the memcg event update didn't happened on the 1024th sample.
The second cgroup was not placed on the soft limit tree and we didn't
try to reclaim the excess pages.

As time goes on, we saw that the first cgroup was kept close to its
soft limit due to reclaim activities, while the second cgroup's memory
usage slowly creep up as it keeps getting missed from the soft limit tree
update as the update didn't fall on the modulo 1024 sample.  As a result,
the memory usage of the second cgroup keeps growing over the soft limit
for a long time due to its relatively rare occurrence.

Something like this?
