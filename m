Which operation (except for the resume) in the trigger and the pointer
callbacks need the action that need to sleep?  I thought the sync with
the command queue is done in the sync_stop.  And most of others seem
already taking the spinlock in themselves, so the non-atomic operation
has little merit for them.

That would work, but it's of course just papering over it :)

Sure, it needs a function exposed from vmalloc.c.  But I don't think
the locking is the problem as find_vmap_area() already takes care of
it, and we don't release the vmalloced pages while invoking this
function.  Of course I might overlook something, but my point is that
this kind of work should be rather in the core (or at least most of
the important steps in the code should be in the core code).
