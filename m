What do you exactly mean by this last sentence?

If we are idling at that moment waiting for more IO from in service queue,
I agree. But that doesn't seem to be part of your condition above?

This last restriction is not ideal for cases like jbd2 thread since it may
still lead to pointless idling but I understand that without some
restriction like this several waking threads could just starve other ones.
So I guess it's fine for now.
