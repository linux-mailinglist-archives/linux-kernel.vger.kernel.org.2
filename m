My idea was to use the second argument for reading the state of mux to
be set after increasing the #mux-control-cells value to 2. I don't think
this will break the existing mux controller users as the second argument
was not used till now, would be equivalent to adding an additional feature.

One more question that I had is, if the number of arguments match the
#mux-control-cells and if the number of arguments are greater than 1 why
is an error being returned?

Yes, I understand that reading the state of the mux in drivers would not
be efficient as it would adding the boiler plate code in each of the
drivers. However, for phys as each of them can be used for a different
interface, I am not sure if a common mux phy wrapper can be introduced.
This is reason why I felt that drivers should be allowed to read the
state of the mux directly, when no mux wrapper application is suitable
for it.
