No new things actually, sorry for confusing and will update the commit 
message in next version.

I also think nr_failed should record the number of pages, not the number 
of hugetlb, if I understand you correctly.

OK, thanks for pointing out the issue.

But before my patch, we've already returned the number of pages 
successed or failed for THP migration, instead of the number of THP. 
That means if we just move only 1 page by move_pages() and if this page 
is 2M THP, so move_pages() will return 512 if failed to migrate, which 
is larger than the page count specified from user.

if (err > 0)
	err += nr_pages - i - 1;

On the other hand, the stats of PGMIGRATE_SUCCESS/PGMIGRATE_FAIL should 
stand for the number of pages, instead of the number of hugetlb. Also 
for hugetlb migration when memory compaction, we've already counted the 
number of pages for a hugetlb into cc->nr_migratepages, if the hugetlb 
migration failed, the trace stat of compaction will be confusing if we 
return the number of hugetlb.

trace_mm_compaction_migratepages(cc->nr_migratepages, err, 
                                   &cc->migratepages);

So I think the stats of hugetlb migration should be consistent with THP.

I don't think we should update the comments of migrate_pages(), "Returns 
the number of pages that were not migrated" makes sense to me if I 
understand correctly.

For the manpage of move_pages(), as you said, the the returned 
non-migrate page numbers can be larger than the numbers specified from 
user if failed to migrate a THP or a hugetlb. I am not sure if we should 
change the manpage, since the THP already did, but I can send a patch to 
update the manpage if you think this is still necessary. Thanks.
