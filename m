There are two easy possibilities.

- All of the devices on the filesystem show up in sysfs with unique
  major minor numbers.
- None of the devices on the filesystem show up in sysfs.
  (Which I believe is what devpts does).

I favor none of the virtual devices showing up in sysfs.  Maybe existing
userspace needs the devices in sysfs, but if the solution is simply to
skip sysfs for virtual devices that is much simpler.
