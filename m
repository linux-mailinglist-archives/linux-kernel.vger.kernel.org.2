Why do we need to pin for gpu atomics? You still have the callback for
cpu faults, so you
can move the page as needed, and hence a long-term pin sounds like the
wrong approach.

That would avoid all the hacking around long term pin constraints, because
for real unmoveable long term pinned memory we really want to have all
these checks. So I think we might be missing some other callbacks to be
able to move these pages, instead of abusing longterm pins for lack of
better tools.
