While UTF-8 characters can be used at the Linux documentation,
the best is to use them only when ASCII doesn't offer a good replacement.
So, replace the occurences of the following UTF-8 characters:

	- U+201c ('“'): LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK
	- U+201d ('”'): RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK
	- U+2217 ('∗'): ASTERISK OPERATOR
