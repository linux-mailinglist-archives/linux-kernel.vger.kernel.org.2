Here is an attempt to do that and coming from
https://bugs.debian.org/988574 for the change change submission.

Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: sun8i: h3: orangepi-plus: Fix ethernet phy-mode

Commit bbc4d71d6354 ("net: phy: realtek: fix rtl8211e rx/tx delay
config") sets the RX/TX delay according to the phy-mode property in the
device tree. For the Orange Pi Plus board this is "rgmii", which is the
wrong setting.

Following the example of a900cac3750b ("ARM: dts: sun7i: a20: bananapro:
Fix ethernet phy-mode") the phy-mode is changed to "rgmii-id" which gets
the Ethernet working again on this board.

Fixes: bbc4d71d6354 ("net: phy: realtek: fix rtl8211e rx/tx delay config")
