Yes, I meant literally inside the same condition where we currently set 
"pgtbl_cfg.quirks |= IO_PGTABLE_QUIRK_NON_STRICT;" in 
arm_smmu_init_domain_context().

Well, if you were to rewrite the config with an alternative set of 
flush_ops at that point it would be implicit. For a flag, probably 
either in arm_smmu_domain or arm_smmu_impl. Maybe a flag would be less 
useful than generalising straight to a "maximum number of by-VA 
invalidations it's worth sending individually" threshold value? It's 
clear to me what overall shape and separation of responsibility is most 
logical, but beyond that I don't have a particularly strong opinion on 
the exact implementation; I've just been chucking ideas around :)

Cheers,
Robin.
