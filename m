Yep, that's basically what I was thinking.

As I look again, I think we have a similar ToC/ToU race in the
ceph_set_encryption_policy part of the patch too. That layout check is
done without any locking or caps held. I think we could end up with a
similar race there too, where another task or client changes the layout
just after we've checked it.

It's not clear to me what caps we need to hold to ensure that the layout
remains stable. I guess I need to go stare at the MDS code some more...
