Then please do so.

No; it's about *consistency*, and avoiding unnecssary special cases. The
whole point is that marking the generic timer as C3STOP *accurately*
describes how the timer behaves on your platform, and marking the MCTv2
as a percpu timer which *can* act as a back-up also aligns with that.

That approach leaves the policy in the kernel, and we can play about
with that later without functional breakage.

It's also worth nothing that the case described for 6282edb72bed is
really a system design erratum, since the counter is supposed to be in
an always-on power domain and should be counting well before a regular
OS kernel boots. The arm64 kernel requires the architected counter to be
running before it is entered, or there will be subtle breakage.

No; placing a rating value in the DT is a hack. That should *not* live
in the DT because it's linux-internal detail and not a description of
the HW.

Thanks,
Mark.
