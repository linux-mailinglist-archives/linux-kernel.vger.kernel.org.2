  The registers READ_LOCATION & READ_LOCATION_LAST are not associated 
with number of code words.
  These two registers are used to access the location inside a code word. 
So whether we are having 4 code words
  or 8 code words it doesn't matter. If we wanted access the location 
within normal code word we have to
  use READ_LOCATION register and if we wanted to access location in last 
code word then we have to use
  READ_LOCATION_LAST.
