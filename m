This boost thing wasn't an issue for us, because we didn't have
platforms which come with it (till recently). I've checked that you have
quite a few CPUs which support huge boost freq, e.g. 5GHz vs. 3.6GHz
nominal max freq [1]. Am I reading this correctly as kernel boost freq?
Do you represent this 5GHz as 1024 capacity?
 From this schedutil get_next_freq() I would guess yes.

I cannot find if you use thermal pressure, could you help me with this,
please?
