Well, perhaps it should do one of those things then?  Like I say this is
very clearly not a regulator, it looks like a consumer of some kind.
The regulator API isn't there just to absorb things that need reference
counting, it's there to represent things providing supplies.  This seems
to be very clearly not a supply given that it's grouping together a
bunch of other supplies and switching them on and off together without
providing a clear output supply.

I don't know what that suggestion was?  If there's only one device that
uses this why is it not implemented as part of that device?

You should not be implementing this as a regulator at all.
