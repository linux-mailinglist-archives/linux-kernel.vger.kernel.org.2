It should not be user-visible. Or at least not user-visible for what
any user would notice. If an event is not part of the perf context on
another thread sharing the mm, does that thread need rdpmc access? No
access would be a user-visible change, but I struggle with how that's
a useful scenario?

Right, that's what patch 3 does. When we mmap/munmap an event, then
the perf core invokes the callback only on the active contexts in
which the event resides.

It's just a rename of the callback though.

It's not just the whole mm here as changing sysfs rdpmc permission is
a global state.

perf. On a context switch, perf is going to context switch the events
and set the access based on an event in the context being mmapped.
Though I guess if rdpmc needs to be enabled without any events opened,
this is not going to work. So maybe I need to keep the
rdpmc_always_available_key and rdpmc_never_available_key cases here.

The always available case is something we specifically don't want to
support for arm64. I'm trying to start with access more locked down,
rather than trying to lock it down after the fact as x86 is doing.
