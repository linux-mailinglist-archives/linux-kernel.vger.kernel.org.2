does not meet your business or personal ethics, I really like to have
a good relationship with you, and I have a special reason why I
decided to contact you because of the urgency of my situation here.I
came across your e-mail contact prior to a private search while in
need of your assistance.

hoping you will cooperate with me as a partner in a project of
transferring an abandoned fund of a late customer of the bank worth of

$18,000,000 (Eighteen Million Dollars US).

This will be disbursed or shared between the both of us in these
percentages, 55% for me and 45% for you. Contact me immediately if
that is alright with you so that we can enter in agreement before we
start

processing for the transfer of the funds. If you are satisfied with
this proposal, please provide the below details for the Mutual
Confidentiality Agreement:
