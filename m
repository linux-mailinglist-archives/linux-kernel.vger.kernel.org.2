That depends on hardware support (CPUID Faulting or not), version of Xen
(anything before Xen 4.7 is totally insane.Â  Anything more recent is
only moderately insane), and whether the kernel asks via the enlightened
CPUID path or not.

On hardware lacking CPUID faulting, and for a kernel using
native_cpuid() where it ought to be using the PVOP, it sees the real
hardware value of the CPU it happens to be running on.
