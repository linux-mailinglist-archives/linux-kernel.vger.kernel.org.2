So this is just a trigger type control that's in two discontiguous bits
possibly in different registers or something?  This doesn't sound like
anything generic with the API you're describing, if that's what it is
the interface should also handle things like four bits (one for each
type) or having the different values mapped differently within the two
bits that are spread out (eg, you could have one bit for polarity and
another for edge/level).

Like I said in my original review it is extremely hard to tell from your
patch what you are trying to implement, and it's now been more than four
months since you sent it which isn't helping anything.  This means it is
also extremely hard to tell if the patch is doing the same thing as
sub_irq.

IIRC it appeared that there was no top level interrupt status register,
the point with sub_irq is that we don't need to read all the status
registers because there's a top level status register which says which
of them have signals in them (including the possibility that more than
one bit in the top level status might indicate the same leaf status
register).  If the device doesn't have that it doesn't have sub_irqs.
Note that sub_irq only affects status register reads, it doesn't affect
other things like acking or masking.

On the other hand if this *is* the same thing as sub_irqs then why is it
completely separate code and not sharing anything with it?

As I said at the time you need to split this into at least two distinct
patches with clear changelogs which explain what they are trying to
implement, I don't think it's useful to discuss this further without
that.  I can't give you any clearer advice on how to implement whatever
you are trying to implement without having some idea of what that is.

The stride code is executed in all paths, it doesn't add conditional
statements all over the place.  This helps a lot, we know it's being run
all the time as opposed to being a lot of separate code paths that are
rarely run - the case without a stride is just a stride of 1.

I'm not sure macros all over the place is going to be clearer than
conditional statements all over the place.  As with what you were saying
about sub_irq if you think the two things are equivalent then why is one
not implemented in terms of the other rather than doing conditional code
on every single use?

Register a separate regmap-irq for each of these perhiperals in your
list, using the same parent interrupt for all of them and setting
IRQF_SHARED.  They will then be handled like any other shared interrupt,
if the parent interrupt fires then genirq will go through and call each
of the handlers until one reports that it handled an interrupt.
