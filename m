Thanks! We've tried that now and we do have some progress, meaning that
the serial device seems to work as expected (we have some basic
communication working).

The driver that we want to load (drivers/platform/surface/aggregator/)
still doesn't quite load yet, but that now seems to be due to a missing
GPIO driver for an AMDI0031 device. There's again an AMDI0030 in
drivers/pinctrl/pinctrl-amd.c, but this time the definitions do seem a
bit different (compare [5, 6]), specifically there are now two memory
regions (altough the combined size is still the same).

I'll try to have a look around and maybe ping the linux-gpio list if I
don't find anything else. I'll post some patches once we've got the
driver loading properly and can run some more tests.

Regards,
Max
