When Greg said "per-device basis", he afaics meant: per-device in a
system, as a module parameter would also affect a second bluetooth
controller if there was one (say one connected via USB) -- and that
shouldn't happen.

And FWIW: it's still a regression if something that used to work
suddenly requires a module parameter to get working.

So if this just affects two macs, why can't the fix be realized as a
quirk that is only enabled on those two systems? Or are they impossible
to detect clearly via DMI data or something like that?

Ciao, Thorsten
