I am sorry but I really do not follow. Maybe I am missing something
obvious but the the rate of events (charge/uncharge) shouldn't be really
important. There is no way to exceed the limit without charging memory
(either a new or via task migration in v1 and immigrate_on_move). If you
have SOFTLIMIT_EVENTS_TARGET 8 then you should be 128 * 8 events to
re-evaluate. Huge pages can make the runaway much bigger but how it
would be possible to runaway outside of that bound.

Btw. do we really need SOFTLIMIT_EVENTS_TARGET at all? Why cannot we
just stick with a single threshold? mem_cgroup_update_tree can be made
a effectivelly a noop when there is no soft limit in place so overhead
shouldn't matter for the vast majority of workloads.
