In Dmitry's case, we have an external chip with that needs to be powered
on per a specific sequence, at which point the WiFi driver on PCIe and
BT driver on serdev will be able to communicate with the device.

The extended case of this is where we have an SDX55 modem soldered onto
the pcb next to the SoC, in which case the power sequencing is even more
complex and additionally there are incoming gpios used to detect things
such as the firmware of the modem has crashed and Linux needs to toggle
power and rescan the PCIe bus.

In both of these cases it seems quite reasonable to represent that
external chip (and it's power needs) as a separate DT node. But we need
a way to link the functional devices to that thing.
