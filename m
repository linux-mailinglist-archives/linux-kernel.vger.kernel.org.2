Developers of static analysis tools need some acknowledgment. 
Application to the Linux kernel gives a great capability for that since 
it is a huge and vital open source project. Besides, it is unlikely that 
somebody will be able to develop any valuable QA tool without a numerous 
feedback from users (in case of this sort of tools users are developers 
of target projects). We always welcome any ideas and suggestions how to 
improve a quality of analysis.

We will try to follow your advices to a possible extent. I am not sure 
that this will be the case for thinking outside the box since often it 
requires a deep involvement into the development process. Moreover, it 
may be dangerous to make such big changes without having an appropriate 
experience or/and an ability to test them.

Thank you for your patience!
