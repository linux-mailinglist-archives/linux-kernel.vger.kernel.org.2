It's a known problem I forgot, but this doesn't matter much.

Did you notice the problem with other applications, too?

When you wrote "The sample plays for fraction of a second than
stops.", it means that the speaker-test program stalls?  Or it's
shorter playbacks?

Also, please test booting with snd_usb_audio.lowlatency=0 boot
option.  Does it behave like before again?

I'll need to test my device at first.  Maybe tomorrow.
