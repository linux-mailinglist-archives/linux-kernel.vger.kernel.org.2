This function has quite a number of callers (direct and indirect) so the the
patch is becoming huge. 

One of these callers is thread__find_map, which returns an addr_location
(actually it's an output argument). This addr_location holds references to map,
maps and thread without getting any refcnt (actually in one function it gets it
on the thread and a comment tells to put it once done). If I'm not wrong, this
addr_location is never malloced (always a local variable) and, is should be
present in parts of the code where there should be a refcnt on the thread.
Therefore, maybe it does not get the refcnts since it assumes that thread (upon
which depends maps and as a consequence map) is always refcnted in its context.
However, I think that it should get all refcnts anyways for clarity and to
prevent possible misuses (if I understood correctly, Ian is of the same
opinion).

My solution would be to add the refcnt grabbing for map, maps and thread in
thread__find_map, releasing them in addr_location__put, and then making sure all
callers call it when no longer in use.

Following the same reasoning, I added refcnt grabbing also to mem_info,
branch_info (map was already refcnted, I added it also to maps for coherency),
map_symbol (as in branch_info, I added it to maps), and in other places in which
I saw a pointer was passed without refcounting.

Most changes are quite trivial, however, the changelog is huge:
48 files changed, 472 insertions(+), 157 deletions(-)
Most of them are just returns converted to goto for calling the __put functions.

Doing so, I managed to remove memory leaks caused by refcounting also in perf-
report (I wanted to try also perf top but I encountered another memory-related
issue). However, the changelog is huge and testing all of it is challenging
(especially since I can test missing puts only with ASan's LeakSanitizer and its
reports are usually full of leaks, which I am trying to fix along the way, I
will send some patches in the following days). How would you go about it? Do you
have any suggestions?

This issue is easier to solve than expected since the map is returned as **mapp,
so it's just a matter of making sure that the caller always passes it and then
puts the refcnt.
