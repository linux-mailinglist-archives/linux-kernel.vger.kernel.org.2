That's a call :)

Yes, it has when it is combined with other devices having also power
values, like the CPUs and hopefully the DMC soon.

If we can have more or less consistent power numbers for the DMC, CPU
and GPU on the rock960, with the thermal zone having these three heating
sources, we can use the DTPM framework to act on the power of the whole.

I don't know the best coefficient, 733, 977 or 1780 [1]

The value of 977 sound to me as a starting point.
