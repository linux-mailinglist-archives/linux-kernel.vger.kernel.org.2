After thinking about this some more, this patch does not really
fix a memory leak and should probably not be flagged as a fix
for 258287c994. Memory is not leaked
because the remove callback returns -EBUSY without freeing
mdev storage or resetting the queues.

Under normal circumstances, if the mdev is removed before
the mdev fd is closed (i.e., the guest is shut down), the process
will wait until the fd is closed, at which time the
release callback will get invoked. Since the release callback
clears the KVM pointer from the matrix_mdev, the remove
callback will not return -EBUSY and will in fact free the mdev
storage when it is subsequently invoked.

I am going to change the subject and remove the 'Fixes'
tag as well as the 'Cc' of stable. I'll change the subject to
something like:

"s390/vfio-ap: always free storage for mdev in remove callback"
