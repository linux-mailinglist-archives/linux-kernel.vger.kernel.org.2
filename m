That does look quite simpler :-)

A lesson for me as a reviewer here is to resist biting into the nitty
gritty code details and spend more time on a first conceptual / high level
review pass. It's not the first time I'm guilty of it, so I do need to work
on that.

Ah, this is using tl->mask() which *isn't* masked by the root_domain's
cpu_map...

See comment below on the scan; long story short we could issue this *after*
build_sched_domain() so we can directly use sched_domain_span(sd) which
*is* masked by the cpu_map. This kind of removes the need for that dflags
param, but then we're already sidestepping it for SD_OVERLAP.

EDIT: nope, we have a check against SD_ASYM_CPUCAPACITY in sd_init()... I
guess we could issue asym_cpu_capacity_classify() in sd_init() itself?

The topology isn't going to change between domain rebuilds, so why
recompute the masks? The sched_domain spans are already masked by cpu_map,
so no need to do this masking twice. I'm thinking this scan should be done
once against the cpu_possible_mask - kinda like sched_init_numa() done once
against the possible nodes.

Ideally I'd see this as an __init function, unfortunately we need that to
happen after cpufreq drivers have been loaded (in case all CPUs have same
Âµarch but some can reach higher frequencies, which would yield asymmetry),
and some of those can be built as modules :/

That looks like a NULL deref if the above WARN is hit.
