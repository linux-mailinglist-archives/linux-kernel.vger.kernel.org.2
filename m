You are correct if we are operating from the perf interface.  In sysfs you get
no guarantees, anything can happen.

I see the problem about potentially copying back invalid alues.  I suggest to:

1) use spin_lock_irqsave() in cscfg_set_on_enable() and cscfg_save_on_disable(),
that way the critical section in there is never preempted.

2) introduce cscfg_feature_csdev::enabled to keep track of which feature has
been enabled, and set that flag when the lock is held in cscfg_set_on_enable().

Hopefully that will work.  A generous helping of comments will also go a long
way.
