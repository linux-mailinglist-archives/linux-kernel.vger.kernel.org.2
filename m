For the case policy was de-registered, I think there won't be a problem
because pd_init_fn() is not called yet, and the blkg is not at
blkg_list, it's fine to use this blkg for the new policy.

For the case policy got enabled inbetween, the problem is that the pd
still doesn't have an entry for the policy, perhaps we can call
pd_alloc_fn() additionally in blkg_create?

If checking the blkg in blkg_create() is not a good solution, and we
decide to synchronize alloc-create blkg against policy deactivation.
Since only bfq policy can be deactivated or activated while queue is
not dying, and queue is freezed during activation and deactivation,
can we get a q->q_usage_counter and put it after blkg_create() is done
to prevent concurrent bfq policy activation and deactivation?

Thanks,
Kuai
