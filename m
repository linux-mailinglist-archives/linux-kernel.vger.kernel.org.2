Could you please explain what was changed in rc1?
From my POV accounting is required to help OOM-killer to select proper target.

Any new limits:
a) should be set properly depending on huge number of incoming parameters.
b) should properly notify about hits
c) should be updated properly after b) 
d) do a)-c) automatically if possible

In past OpenVz had own accounting subsystem, user beancounters (UBC).
It accounted and limited 20+ resources  per-container: numfiles, file locks,
signals, netfilter rules, socket buffers and so on.
I assume you want to do something similar, so let me share our experience. 

We had a lot of problems with UBC:
- it's quite hard to set up the limit. 
  Why it's good to consume N entities of some resource but it's bad to consume N+1 ones? 
  per-process? per-user? per-thread? per-task? per-namespace? if nested? per-container? per-host?
  To answer the questions host admin should have additional knowledge and skills.

- Ok, we have set all limits. Some application hits it and fails.
  It's quite hard to understand that application hits the limit, and failed due to this reason.
  From users point of view, if some application does not work (stable enough)
  inside container => containers are guilty.

- It's quite hard to understand that failed application just want to increase limit X up to N entities.

As result both host admins and container users was unhappy.
So after years of such fights we decided just to limit accounted memory instead.

Anyway, OOM-killer must know who consumed memory to select proper target.

Thank you,
