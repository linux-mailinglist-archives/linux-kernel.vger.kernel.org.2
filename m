OK, that is:
	journal->j_flags |= JBD2_FULL_COMMIT_ONGOING;

So likely this is a complaint about j_flags update vs j_flags check race
(we check for JBD2_ABORT flag) all around the code.

So again this is harmless unless the compiler plays some devilish tricks
and doesn't store bogus intermediate values in j_flags during RMW
operations. Not sure how to deal with this one. Just putting data_race()
here doesn't seem right - if the compiler does something unexpected, we are
indeed in trouble. Maybe using bitops for j_flags would be beneficial for
other reasons as well as silencing KCSAN. But it needs more thought.
