Hi,

msm8996.dtsi is gpl2-only, so I wasn't sure I can include it..

Yikes... my mistake

Right. I will add the keys in a separate patch, this one is plenty big already.

Yeah, I think the L2 and cci being stuck at bl clocks are to blame again.. there was a lot of msm8996 cpufreq work but I am not sure if anybody got it to *actually* work in the end, I'll try to look into this soon(tm)..

I believe it was related to the cpufreq-dt madness, I will remove this.

Certainly, but not all peripherals have drivers upstream, and other ones

are hardcoded to their state downstream, and knowing what shady stuff

some vendors do, I'm reluctant to trust the bootloader-default state with

my expensive toys..

That does look like a good idea, but I also think it would become a big

mess if any of these pins turned out required for some obscure peripheral,

and then I'd have to dig it out of there, re-create the pin definition outside

and I think you know where this is going..

Eh, Torvalds said 100 is fine :P
