Dear all,

This patch series make hvc framework pass DMA capable memory to
put_chars() of hvc backend(eg, virtio-console), and revert commit
c4baad5029 ("virtio-console: avoid DMA from stack”)

V1
virtio-console: avoid DMA from vmalloc area
https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/7/27/494

For v1 patch, Arnd Bergmann suggests to fix the issue in the first
place:
Make hvc pass DMA capable memory to put_chars()
The fix suggestion is included in v2.

V2
[PATCH 1/2] tty: hvc: pass DMA capable memory to put_chars()
https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/8/1/8
[PATCH 2/2] virtio-console: remove unnecessary kmemdup()
https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/8/1/9

For v2 patch, Arnd Bergmann suggests to make new buf part of the
hvc_struct structure, and fix the compile issue.
The fix suggestion is included in v3.

V3
[PATCH v3 1/2] tty: hvc: pass DMA capable memory to put_chars()
https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/8/3/1347
[PATCH v3 2/2] virtio-console: remove unnecessary kmemdup()
https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/8/3/1348

For v3 patch, Jiri Slaby suggests to make 'char c[N_OUTBUF]' part of
hvc_struct, and make 'hp->outbuf' aligned and use struct_size() to
calculate the size of hvc_struct. The fix suggestion is included in
v4.

V4
[PATCH v4 0/2] make hvc pass dma capable memory to its backend
https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/8/5/1350
[PATCH v4 1/2] tty: hvc: pass DMA capable memory to put_chars()
https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/8/5/1351
[PATCH v4 2/2] virtio-console: remove unnecessary kmemdup()
https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/8/5/1352

For v4 patch, Arnd Bergmann suggests to introduce another
array(cons_outbuf[]) for the buffer pointers next to the cons_ops[]
and vtermnos[] arrays. This fix included in this v5 patch.

V5
Arnd Bergmann suggests to use "L1_CACHE_BYTES" as dma alignment,
use 'sizeof(long)' as dma alignment is wrong. fix it in v6.

V6
It contains coding error, fix it in v7 and it worked normally
according to test result.
