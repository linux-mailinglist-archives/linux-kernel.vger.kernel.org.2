It should, and I agree that it was a mistake to merge the commit
that added this WARN(). I'm sending a late PR to Linus containing
just the James' fixes. I'll include one line change to that PR,
that does just what you suggested.

It also lacks useful information, i.e. the status.

I just send a fixed with your "suggested-by". Can you review and
ack it ASAP so that I can then go on and send PR to Linus?
