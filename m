So you have a single piece of crypto hardware and you're using the BAM's
LOCK/UNLOCK feature to implement a "mutex" on a particular BAM channel?

It sounds fairly clear that the actual descriptor modification must
happen in the BAM driver, but the question in my mind is how this is
exposed to the DMAengine clients (e.g. crypto, QPIC etc).

What is the life span of the locked state? Do you always provide a
series of descriptors that starts with a LOCK and ends with an UNLOCK?
Or do you envision that the crypto driver provides a LOCK descriptor and
at some later point provides a UNLOCK descriptor?


Finally, this patch just adds the BAM part of things, where is the patch
that actually makes use of this feature?
