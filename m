No biggie, Angelo was first to reply after all :)

Sounds good, thanks!

It is strange indeed.  On MSM89[57]6 (Sony Xperia Loire, 28nm DSI 
PHY/PLL) we don't have this parent hooked up either because of the same 
issue, and it's not a problem there either.  I bet it all comes down to 
slight differences between the various DSI PHY/PLL implementations.

I'll spin that patch as soon as v2 is merged (preventing 
ordering/dependency issues?), feel free to CC me.
