Please send a v2 patch, and then consider starting a new series with the
issues below.

Yes, we have to grab a refcount while we are sure its not going away,
then return that as the lookup result, whoever receives that refcounted
entry should use it and then drop the refcount.

yes

Its good to have new eyes looking at this, exactly at a time we're
discussing further parallelizing perf :-)

Right.

Right, returning an entry needs to take a refcount.

yes

yes, __ in front means, in kernel style, that it does less than the non
__ prefixed, same name, function.

Indeed.

Yes, that function is also problematic.

Thanks for looking into this, please consider sending patches for these
issues,
