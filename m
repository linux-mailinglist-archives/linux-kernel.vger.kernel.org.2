That's for you to determine, right? Only doing half of a clean may
actually be worse than doing nothing at all. At least now it's somewhat
clear why that statement is there.

The jsm_neo.c implements support for a different class of devices and
only those actually use ch_cached_lsr AFAICT.

It would be good if you include some context in the commit message such
as which commit added this code and that it has never been used.
