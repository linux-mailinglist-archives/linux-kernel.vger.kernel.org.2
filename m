LOL, I'm happy to use a rwlock_t instead. Not sure which is faster, to
me I care most about the write path not skewing clock times of the
events being emitted. It seems like the contention case will be low in
most cases, so these paths will be read-only most of the time.

It seems rwlock_t has the disadvantage of the writes blocking on the
realloc/free case during the resize. RCU can delay the free until
something has time to do so, so seems a good fit.

Thoughts?
