Yeah, it's simple and unobtrusive enough that I reckon it's worth going 
straight to the common version if it's worth doing at all.

On second thoughts this is overkill anyway - if you do hook 
iommu_get_def_domain_type(), you're done (in terms of the kernel-managed 
setting, at least); it doesn't matter what iommu_def_domain_type gets 
set to if will never get used. However, since this isn't really a 
per-device thing, it might be more semantically appropriate to leave 
that alone and instead only massage the default type in 
iommu_subsys_init(), as for memory encryption.

When you say "secure the environment", what's the actual threat model 
here, i.e. who's securing what against whom? If it's a device lockdown 
type thing where the system owner wants to defend against the end user 
trying to mess with the software stack or gain access to parts they 
shouldn't, then possibly you can trust the command line, but there are 
definitely other places which need consideration. If on the other hand 
it's more about giving the end user confidence that their choice of 
software stack isn't being interfered with by a malicious host or 
external third parties, then it probably leans towards the opposite 
being true...

If the command line *is* within the threat model, consider "iommu=off" 
and/or "intel_iommu=off" for example: I don't know how PMRs work, but I 
can only imagine that that's liable to leave things either wide open, or 
blocked to the point of no DMA working at all, neither of which seems to 
be what you want. I'm guessing "intel_iommu=tboot_noforce" might have 
some relevant implications too.

Ah, thanks for clarifying - I was wondering about that aspect. FWIW, 
note that that wouldn't actually change any functionality - it's a 
non-default config option anyway, and users could still override it 
either way in a non-secure-launch setup - but it sounds like it might be 
effectively superfluous if you do need to make a more active runtime 
decision anyway.

Cheers,
Robin.
