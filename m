I don't think so. BT part is just a serdev sitting on top of UART,
WiFi is PCIe device (for qca6390). So using MFD API (which primarily
targets platform devices) does not seem logical and feasible.

Ack.

One device = qca6390 (or 91). Because it is still a device sitting on
a PCI bus which is typically discoverable, while adding power
sequencer to the device driver would demand making the bus fully
descibiable (like PCI bus is on Spark).
