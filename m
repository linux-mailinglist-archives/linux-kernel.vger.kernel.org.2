I do not know. Looks like decision of people implementing this driver
and providing DT bindings.

I cannot change this existing DT binding due to backward compatibility.

Mapping address space should work. Also because in UART1 address space
is configuration of UART clock (which is common for both UART1 and
UART2). Moreover each UART has its own bit for disabling clock and these
two bits are in UART1 address space. Also it is a good idea to disable
unused UART clock (which seems to be magically/automatically done by
kernel when nobody use specified UART clock, as UART clock driver
exports two clocks).

If I was designing this driver and DTS bindings I would have choose
something like this:

uart@0x12000 {
    reg = <0x12000 0x18>, <0x12200 0x30>;
    clock-controller {
        ...
    };
    serial1 {
        ...
        status = "disabled";
    };
    serial2 {
        ...
        status = "disabled";
    };
};

Meaning that 0x12000 node would be 3 subnodes and all registers would be
defined in top level nodes and would be handled by one driver.

This is really how hardware block looks like. But it is not backward
compatible...
