I (and several other developers) have been working with David on this
for the last year or so. Would it help if I gave this on the netfs lib
work and the fscache patches?

    Reviewed-and-tested-by: Jeff Layton <jlayton@redhat.com>

My testing has mainly been with ceph. My main interest is that this
allows us to drop a fairly significant chunk of rather nasty code from
fs/ceph. The netfs read helper infrastructure makes a _lot_ more sense
for a networked filesystem, IMO.

The legacy fscache code has some significant bugs too, and this gives it
a path to making better use of more modern kernel features. It should
also be set up so that filesystems can be converted piecemeal.

I'd really like to see this go in.

Cheers,
Jeff
