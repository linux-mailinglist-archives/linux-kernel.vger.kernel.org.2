I didn't "exaggerate" at all.
The numer of interrups is the same. But their usage is completely different.
The type of each timer is different.
And previous MCT can only support upto 8 cores.

* MCTv1 (Let me call previous MCT as MCTv1)
 - 4 global timer + 8 local timer
 - Global timer and local timer are totally different.
 - 4 global timer have only one 64bit FRC that serves as the "up-counter" with 4 "comparators"
 - 8 local timer have 8 of 32bit FRC that serves as the "down-counter" without any "comparators".(just expire timer)
 - local timer can be used as per-cpu event timer, so it can only support upto 8 cores.

* MCTv2
 - There are no global timer and local timer anymore.
 - 1 of 64bit FRC that serves as "up-counter" (just counter without "comparators")
 - 12 comaprators (These are not "counter") can be used as per-cpu event timer so that it can support upto 12 cores.
 - RTC source can be used as backup source.

Yes, this is absolutely correct on event timer.
We cannot use arm arch timer which is operating based on PPI as per-cpu event timer because of poewr mode.
We have to use SPI for per-cpu timer interrupt. (This is the same in all Exynos platform)

If MCTv2 has only changes in register layout, I can consider merging work.
But this is not that case.

You gave a example with PMIC, SoC clock, Pinctrl, ChipId.
These H/W IP have only changes in register layout which came from difference of each SoC.

Were these H/W IP version changed?
Were these H/W IP control method changed ?
No. It only has minor chagnes not major changes.

* PMIC - controls the PMIC reigster with I2C interface regarding their SoC usecase.
       - there is no changes on H/W control method itself.

* SoC Clock - changes only in register layout regarding SoC
            - Clock control method still the same.

* Pinctrl - changes only in gpio pin register layout (pin number, pin type, pin map..) regarding SoC.
	  - Is there any changes on control method ?

* Chipid - This is very simple H/W IP. It only supports unique chip id value with read-only register.
         - It really only have changes in register layout.

MCTv2 is different.
Not only register layout but also it's control method has to be changed regarding H/W difference.
