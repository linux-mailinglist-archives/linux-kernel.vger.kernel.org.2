Hi Ulf,


Thanks, I understand what you mean.

I simply searched for the keyword "MMC_READ_MULTIPLE_BLOCK" in the
drivers/mmc/host folder, and found that in some SD/MMC host controller
driver codes such as alcor.c, cavium.c, ...etc, there are also
behaviors for monitoring the request in their driver. What's the
difference between theirs and ours?

And if the code that monitors the requstes does not belong the driver,
where should I implement the code and how to add some functions only
for GL9763e in that place, in your opinion?

Thanks for clarifying my questions.


Best regards,

Renius
