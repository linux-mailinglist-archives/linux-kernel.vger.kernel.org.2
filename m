Hi Dan!
That's a great work you did there. Thank you for trying to help,
really appreciate it. :D

As of now, I digged into my old backup partitions and found an image
of an ubuntu VM that I used to mess with linux source a couple of weeks
ago and luckily I had a clone of both linux-mainline and linux-next
trees in it. So I have updated those and using them currently.

My internet problems are temporary, as I will move back to my original
location, which has good internet speeds, next month.

Again, thank you for trying to help me! I will definitely contact you
if I ever need them. :D

Regards,
Atul
