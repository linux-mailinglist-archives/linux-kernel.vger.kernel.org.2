4s holding time is _way_ too long and something that this path should
never really reach. We are talking about SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX worth of LRU
pages. Sure there might be a bunch of pages freed that are not on LRU
but those are only added to a list. So again what is the actual problem?

Aren't you sacrificing one batching over the other and the net result
will really depend on particullar workload. This will effectivelly throw
away any lruvec batching out of window in presence of contention even if
there are no pages to be freed (or only very few of them).

TBH I really have hard time to see how 32 LRU pages handling in a single
lock batch can be harmfull. Maybe if there are gazillions of non-lru
pages where holding the lock is clearly pointless but that shouldn't
really happen most of the time.
