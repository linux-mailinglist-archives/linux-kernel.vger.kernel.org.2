I will add some more information in the cover letter of the next version.

Basically, SEV will mostly be used by cloud providers for providing
confidential VMs. Since they are limited we need a good way to schedule
these jobs in cloud infrastructure. To achieve this we either come up
with some ioctl for "/dev/sev" to know about its usage, availability,
etc. This requires existing scheduling mechanism in the cloud to have an
extension for this interaction. Now same thing needs to be done for TDX.
IBM SEID doesn't have scarcity of this resource but they are also
interested in tracking and limiting the usage. Each one coming up with
their own interaction is a duplicate effort when they all need similar
thing. One can say that abstraction should be at KVM level but these
resources can be used outside VM as well.

Most of the cloud infrastructure use cgroups for knowing the host state,
track the resources usage, enforce limits on them, etc. They use this
info to optimize work allocation in the fleet and make sure no rogue job
consumes more than it needs and starves other. Adding these resources
to cgroup is a natural choice with least friction. Cgroup itself says it
is a mechanism to distribute system resources along the hierarchy in a
controlled mechanism and configurable manner. Most of the resources in
cgroups are abstracted enough but their are still resources which are
not abstract but have limited availability or have specific use cases.

As per my understanding this is the only for way for loadable modules
(kvm-amd in this case) to access Kernel APIs. Let me know if there is a
better way to do it.

I will work on them.

I appreciate you guys taking out time and helping me out with this patch
series.

Thanks
