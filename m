You're right, that's not required.

PREALLOCATED implies RESERVED, but the reverse isn't true.

One thing I was concerned about is that this cpuhp callback can be invoked
more than once on the same CPU, even with the removal in patch 3.
Consider a system with maxcpus=X on the cmdline; not all secondaries will
be brought up in smp_init(). You then get to userspace which can issue all
sorts of hotplug sequences. Let me try to paint a picture:

  maxcpus=2

  CPU0                      CPU1                      CPU2

  its_init()                                          <nothing ever happens here>
  [...]
  its_cpu_memreserve_lpi()
    flags |= RESERVED
  [...]
  smp_init()
                            its_cpu_memreserve_lpi()
                              flags |= RESERVED

                         [.....]

  cpu_down(CPU1, CPUHP_OFFLINE)
  cpu_up(CPU1, CPUHP_ONLINE)

                            its_cpu_memreserve_lpi()
                              // pend_page != NULL && (flags & RESERVED) != 0
                              // we musn't free the memory

Now, my approach clearly isn't great (I also went through the "wait those
two flags are the same thing" phase, which in hindsight wasn't a good sign).
What we could do instead is only have a PREALLOCATED flag (or RESERVED; in
any case just one rather than two) set in its_cpu_init_lpis(), and ensure
each CPU only ever executes the body of the callback exactly once.

  if (already_booted())
      return 0;

  if (PREALLOCATED)
      its_free_pending_table();
  else
      gic_reserve_range();

  out:
    // callback removal faff here
    return 0;

Unfortunately, the boot CPU will already be present in
cpus_booted_once_mask when this is first invoked for the BP, so AFAICT we'd
need some new tracking utility (either a new RDIST_LOCAL flag or a separate
cpumask).

WDYT?
