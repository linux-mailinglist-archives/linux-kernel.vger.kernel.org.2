It's no regression but the right behavior.  This indicates that you're
trying a stream in 44.1kHz in one side of the full duplex stream while
48kHz in another rate, and this cannot work properly with the implicit
feedback devices.

It might have worked casually by some reason on your device, but it
was just a coincidence, as it didn't follow exactly what the implicit
feedback mode requires (i.e. the playback packet must follow exactly
the incoming recording packet).

That said, for the device like this, the sample rate has to be fixed
for both streams.

Hope that clarifies the situation.
