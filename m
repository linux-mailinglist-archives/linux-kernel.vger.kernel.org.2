I forgot to say earlier; I did add a test (lib/test_free_pages.c).
Doubling it up to check GFP_KERNEL | GFP_ACCOUNT and GFP_KERNEL |
GFP_COMP | GFP_ACCOUNT should be reasonable.

Oh, the ifdef was just a strawman.  I wouldn't want to see that upstream;
something like:

	unsigned long memcg_data = __get_memcg_data(page);
...
			__set_memcg_data(tail, memcg_data);

with the appropriate ifdefs hidden in memcontrol.h would be my preference.

I suspect it got backported ...
https://github.com/mpe/linux-fullhistory/wiki is what I'm using for my
archaeology, and it doesn't have the stable branches (1.0, 1.2, 2.0,
2.2, 2.4), so I don't know for sure.

Anyway, my point is that the truly ancient drivers *don't* depend on this
behaviour because the function didn't even exist when they were written.
