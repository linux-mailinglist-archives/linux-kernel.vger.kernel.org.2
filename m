I am not sure I follow or why PR_SET_IO_FLUSHER should be relevant. But
triggering the global OOM killer on kmem charge limit failure is
certainly not the right thing to do. Quite opposite because this would
be effectivelly a global DoS as a result of a local memory constrain.

This is all fine but I am not sure how this is realated to this patch.
The previous patch already gives up in pagefault_out_of_memory on fatal
signal pending. So this code is not really reachable.

Also alowing more allocations to fail doesn't really suggest that we
should trigger OOM killer from #PF. I would argue that the opposite is
the case actually. Or I just haven't understood your concern?
