Why not? Why can't you put the security identity of the task into the creds?

SELinux already identifies tasks through their creds (see e.g.
task_sid_obj()), and doesn't use the task security blob at all.
Apparmor also identifies tasks through their creds (see
aa_current_raw_label() and __aa_task_raw_label()), and just uses the
task blob to store information about other labels that the process may
transition from or to.

From what I can tell, the only LSM that actually identifies the
caller's security context through the task security blob is Tomoyo. As
far as I know, that means Tomoyo is kinda broken. (But does anyone
even use Tomoyo?)

You fundamentally can't identify the recipient of a binder transaction
through its task_struct, because the recipient might have given the
binder FD to a child process and executed a setuid binary since it
opened /dev/binder. If you look at the credentials of the task on the
other side, you'll just see the setuid binary that doesn't even know
it has an open binder FD, and won't see the child process that is
actually going to receive the transaction.

You can't even usefully identify the opener of a file through its
task_struct - especially with io_uring, any userspace process can
cause kernel threads to open files and perform I/O on them *on behalf
of userspace* - and this "on behalf of" relationship is only visible
in the overridden credentials. (And yes, I do think that means Tomoyo
doesn't work properly on systems with io_uring.)
