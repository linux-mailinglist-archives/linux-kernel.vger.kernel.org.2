For definiteness, here is the first part of the change, posted earlier.
The commit log needs to be updated.  I will post the change that keeps
the tick going as a reply to this email.

commit 4f659bf04fc4610523544493d6db92fc8670b086
Author: Paul E. McKenney <paulmck@kernel.org>
Date:   Fri Feb 12 16:20:40 2021 -0800

    softirq: Don't try waking ksoftirqd before it has been spawned
    
    If there is heavy softirq activity, the softirq system will attempt
    to awaken ksoftirqd and will stop the traditional back-of-interrupt
    softirq processing.  This is all well and good, but only if the
    ksoftirqd kthreads already exist, which is not the case during early
    boot, in which case the system hangs.
    
    One reproducer is as follows:
    
    tools/testing/selftests/rcutorture/bin/kvm.sh --allcpus --duration 2 --configs "TREE03" --kconfig "CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC=y CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING=y" --bootargs "threadirqs=1" --trust-make
    
    This commit therefore adds a couple of existence checks for ksoftirqd
    and forces back-of-interrupt softirq processing when ksoftirqd does not
    yet exist.  With this change, the above test passes.
