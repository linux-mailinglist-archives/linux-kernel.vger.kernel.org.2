And have you seen this in the real world?  I keep asking this as module
removal is not an automated process so what triggers this?

Why do you feel that block devices are somehow more "special" here?

They are not, either this is "broken" for everyone, or it works for
everyone, don't special-case one tiny class of devices for unknown
reasons.

Your change causes another problem, if a sysfs file has show/store
happening, the reference count will always be bumped and so the module
would NOT be able to be freed.  That looks like a lovely DoS that any
user could cause, right?

In sleeping on this the "correct" solution is to grab the bus lock (or
ktype lock) for the device during show/store so that the "delete device"
process can not race with it.  Also let's make sure that the kref of the
kobject is being properly bumped during show/store as well, I don't
think that's happening which isn't a good thing no matter what
(different type of bug).

If that lock addition ends up showing up in benchmarks, then we can
always move it to rcu.

So in conclusion, the "correct" thing here seems to be two independant
things:
	- make sure the reference count of the kobject is properly
	  incremented during show/store callbacks
	- grab the kobject's type/bus/whatever lock during show/store so
	  that it can not race with deleting the device.

No bus/type should be special cased here, block devices are not special
by any means.

And don't mess with module reference counts, that way lies madness.  We
want to lock data, not code :)
