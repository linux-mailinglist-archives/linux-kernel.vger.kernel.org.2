If the maintainers or users expressed wish to keep them alive, let's
keep them. In fact there might be some industrial machine working for 20
more years...

If you did not receive any feedback about your queries, I am happy to
add similar deprecation-warning notes to these as well. Just let me know
which one should be affected.

I like that idea, I'll use it in v2. No one really should build a real
config with COMPILE_TEST and I want to nag and find the real users.

It fails, I tried it. That's why #pragma.
