Right. E.g. not uncommon with REST APIs. They survive disconnect easily
and use cookies or such.

the point is that instead of all that you discover transaction as
a duplicate and revert it.

I wonder whether something similar is possible here. I.e. use the secret
to encrypt stuff but check the gen ID before actually sending data.
If it changed re-encrypt. Hmm?

Something I am still not clear on is whether it's really important to
skip the system call here. If not I think it's prudent to just stick
to read for now, I think there's a slightly lower chance that
it will get misused. mmap which gives you a laggy gen id value
really seems like it would be hard to use correctly.

Well you can use a firewall or such to block incoming packets,
but I am not at all sure that means e.g. all socket buffers
are empty.
