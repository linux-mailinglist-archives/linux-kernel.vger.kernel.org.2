I'm also concerned about the handling of other fields in runtime
object, maybe allocating a complete runtime object for each BE is an
overkill and fragile.  Could it be rather only hw_constraints to be
unique for each BE, instead?

Also, the last patch allows only IRAM type, which sounds already
doubtful.  The dmaengine code should be generic.

Last but not least, one minor nitpick: please use EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL()
for the newly introduced symbols.


thanks,

Takashi
