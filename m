The number of registered softirq handlers does not matter nor the amount
times the individual softirqs that were scheduled. The only problem is
that one schedules softirq and then waits for its completion.
So scheduling a timer_list timer works. Waiting for its completion does
not. Once ksoftirqd is up, will be processed.

The problem is that a softirq is raised and being waited for its
completion.
Something like synchronize_rcu() would be such a thing I guess.

This should work.
