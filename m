dispcc is powered by the MMCX power domain, so it needs to be on if you
want to touch the registers.

I presume that for genpd this might not be a problem as long as all the
exposed power domains are parented by the genpd provider's parent, as
the core would turn the parent on before and turn off after performing
those operations. But without attaching to the domain we don't have
power to get through probe/registration.

Further more, dispcc is also a clock driver and there's certainly
operations where the genpd framework won't save us.

Right, this relationship is today missing and is what Dmitry needs to
add - so that the parent domains stays powered even when we're not
keeping the parent domain enabled to poke the dispcc.

This was my initial feeling to the patch as well and I think it might be
better to push the pm_runtime_get/put operations into gdsc.c - in
particular if you're saying that the general case is not for the genpd
provider itself to be powered by the specified parent domain.

At least we could start by doing it manually in gdsc.c and possibly move
it into the framework if we're confident that it's a good idea.
