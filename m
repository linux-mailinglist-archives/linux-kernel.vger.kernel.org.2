Freeing irq in ->remove() is earlier than in device manage framework, if
just remove the free_irq() in svc_i3c_master_remove() and free the irq by
device manage framework, I am not sure if it breaks the resource free
sequence in Silvaco I3C master driver. If it's OK, I can resend a patch with
removing the free_irq().
