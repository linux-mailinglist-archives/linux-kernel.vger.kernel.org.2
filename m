I do not agree that writing C filters is a hassle e.g. a minimal do-nothing
filter is only a few lines:

#include <perf/perf_dlfilter.h>

int filter_event(void *data, const struct perf_dlfilter_sample *sample, void *ctx)
{
	return 0;
}

(Actually, the filter program does not have to have any LOC at all, but that
is not much of an example)

Additionally, a script to do the build is fairly trivial e.g. I use this:

$ cat `which make-dlfilter.sh `
#!/bin/bash

set -ex

if test -z "${1}" ; then
        echo "Name required"
        exit 1
fi

name="${1%.c}"

if test "${name}" = "${1}" ; then
        name="${1%.so}"
fi

gcc -c -I ~/include -fpic "${name}.c"

gcc -shared -o "${name}.so" "${name}.o"

AFAICT the Python C API used to interface to Python performs fairly similarly
to the Python interpreter.

I expect there are ways to make it more efficient, but I doubt it would ever
come close to C.

If gcc is available, perf script could, in fact, build the .so on the fly
since the compile time is very quick.

Another point is that filters can be used for more than just filtering.
Here is an example which sums cycles per-cpu and prints them, and the difference
to the last print, at the beginning of each line.  I think this was something
you were interested in doing?


#include <perf/perf_dlfilter.h>
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAX_CPU 4096

__u64 cycles[MAX_CPU];
__u64 cycles_rpt[MAX_CPU];

int filter_event_early(void *data, const struct perf_dlfilter_sample *sample, void *ctx)
{
	__s32 cpu = sample->cpu;

	if (cpu >=0 && cpu < MAX_CPU)
		cycles[cpu] += sample->cyc_cnt;
	return 0;
}

int filter_event(void *data, const struct perf_dlfilter_sample *sample, void *ctx)
{
	__s32 cpu = sample->cpu;

	if (cpu >=0 && cpu < MAX_CPU) {
		printf("%10llu %10llu ", cycles[cpu], cycles[cpu] - cycles_rpt[cpu]);
		cycles_rpt[cpu] = cycles[cpu];
	} else {
		printf("%22s", "");
	}
	return 0;
}

const char *filter_description(const char **long_description)
{
	return "Print the number of cycles at the start of each line";
}
