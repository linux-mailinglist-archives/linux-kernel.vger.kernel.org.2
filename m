Clearing of local variables is never guaranteed to work properly, as the
compiler can create multiple copies and/or put them in registers.  It's much
more likely to work for arrays than simple variables though (and not cause the
variable to be unnecessarily spilled from registers to the stack), so that is
the only one the kernel really bothers with.
