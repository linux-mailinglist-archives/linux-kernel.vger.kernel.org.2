Paolo was pointing out that kvm_vcpu_has_events() already checks hv_timer_pending,
and that we could add the few missing nested event cases to kvm_vcpu_has_events()
instead of wholesale checking everything that's in check_nested_events().

I believe that would work, as I suspect the underlying bug that was alluded to
by commit 0ad3bed6c5ec ("kvm: nVMX: move nested events check to kvm_vcpu_running")
has since been fixed.  But, I'm not sure it makes much difference in practice
since we'll likely end up with nested_ops->has_events() either way.

Staring a bit more, I'm pretty sure hv_timer_pending() can be made obsolete and
dropped.  Unless Paolo objects, I still like my original proposal.

I think the safest approach from a bisection standpoint would be to do this in
3-4 stages:

  1. Refactor check_nested_events() to split out a has_events() helper.
  2. Move the has_events() call from kvm_vcpu_running() into kvm_vcpu_has_events()
  3. Drop the explicit hv_timer_pending() in inject_pending_event().  It should
     be dead code since it's just a pointer to nested_vmx_preemption_timer_pending(),
     which is handled by vmx_check_nested_events() and called earlier.
  4. Drop the explicit hv_timer_pending() in kvm_vcpu_has_events() for the same
     reasons as (3).  This can also drop hv_timer_pending() entirely.
