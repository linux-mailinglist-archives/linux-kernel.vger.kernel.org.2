I'm afraid I don't see what you're proposing.

Afaict we need one set of dp_test{type,active,data} per DP controller,
so even doing this by keeping track of the dentries requires that we
rename the files based on some identifier (id or connector name) - which
will cause igt to break.

As such, I think the practical path forward is that we merge the
multi-DP series as currently proposed. This will not cause any issues on
single-DP systems, but on multi-DP systems we will have warnings about
duplicate debugfs entries in the kernel logs.

Then you can figure out how to rework igt to deal with the multiple DP
instances and update the dp_debug interface accordingly.


Which also implies that we should hold this patch back. But if we go
that path, I think we should fix dp_debug_deinit() so that it doesn't
remove /sys/kernel/debug/dri/128 when the DP driver is unloaded.
