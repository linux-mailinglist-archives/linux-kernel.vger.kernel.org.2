Switched maintainer from Lina to Bjorn.

Doesn't fix:
```
idle-states: 'spc' does not match any of the regexes: '^(cpu|cluster)-', 'pinctrl-[0-9]+'
```
from colliding arm/idle-states.yaml .

v2
 - maintainer is now Bjorn
 - fixed some newlines
 - specified exact state names (added $)

-QCOM Idle States for cpuidle driver
-
-ARM provides idle-state node to define the cpuidle states, as defined in [1].
-cpuidle-qcom is the cpuidle driver for Qualcomm SoCs and uses these idle
-states. Idle states have different enter/exit latency and residency values.
-The idle states supported by the QCOM SoC are defined as -
-
-    * Standby
-    * Retention
-    * Standalone Power Collapse (Standalone PC or SPC)
-    * Power Collapse (PC)
-
-Standby: Standby does a little more in addition to architectural clock gating.
-When the WFI instruction is executed the ARM core would gate its internal
-clocks. In addition to gating the clocks, QCOM cpus use this instruction as a
-trigger to execute the SPM state machine. The SPM state machine waits for the
-interrupt to trigger the core back in to active. This triggers the cache
-hierarchy to enter standby states, when all cpus are idle. An interrupt brings
-the SPM state machine out of its wait, the next step is to ensure that the
-cache hierarchy is also out of standby, and then the cpu is allowed to resume
-execution. This state is defined as a generic ARM WFI state by the ARM cpuidle
-driver and is not defined in the DT. The SPM state machine should be
-configured to execute this state by default and after executing every other
-state below.
-
-Retention: Retention is a low power state where the core is clock gated and
-the memory and the registers associated with the core are retained. The
-voltage may be reduced to the minimum value needed to keep the processor
-registers active. The SPM should be configured to execute the retention
-sequence and would wait for interrupt, before restoring the cpu to execution
-state. Retention may have a slightly higher latency than Standby.
-
-Standalone PC: A cpu can power down and warmboot if there is a sufficient time
-between the time it enters idle and the next known wake up. SPC mode is used
-to indicate a core entering a power down state without consulting any other
-cpu or the system resources. This helps save power only on that core.  The SPM
-sequence for this idle state is programmed to power down the supply to the
-core, wait for the interrupt, restore power to the core, and ensure the
-system state including cache hierarchy is ready before allowing core to
-resume. Applying power and resetting the core causes the core to warmboot
-back into Elevation Level (EL) which trampolines the control back to the
-kernel. Entering a power down state for the cpu, needs to be done by trapping
-into a EL. Failing to do so, would result in a crash enforced by the warm boot
-code in the EL for the SoC. On SoCs with write-back L1 cache, the cache has to
-be flushed in s/w, before powering down the core.
-
-Power Collapse: This state is similar to the SPC mode, but distinguishes
-itself in that the cpu acknowledges and permits the SoC to enter deeper sleep
-modes. In a hierarchical power domain SoC, this means L2 and other caches can
-be flushed, system bus, clocks - lowered, and SoC main XO clock gated and
-voltages reduced, provided all cpus enter this state.  Since the span of low
-power modes possible at this state is vast, the exit latency and the residency
-of this low power mode would be considered high even though at a cpu level,
-this essentially is cpu power down. The SPM in this state also may handshake
-with the Resource power manager (RPM) processor in the SoC to indicate a
-complete application processor subsystem shut down.
-
-The idle-state for QCOM SoCs are distinguished by the compatible property of
-the idle-states device node.
