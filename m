I would suggest aiming for something like devptsfs without the
complication of /dev/ptmx.

That is a pseudo filesystem that has a control node and virtual block
devices that were created using that control node.

That is the cleanest solution I know and is not strictly limited to use
with containers so it can also gain greater traction.  The interaction
with devtmpfs should be simply having devtmpfs create a mount point for
that filesystem.

This could be a new cleaner api for things like loopback devices.

However the limitation for block devices that I am aware of is that we
don't currently have any filesystems in the kernel that are written
robustly enough that we can be expected to be secure when mounted on top
of an evil block device.  Some of the network filesystems are built
to withstand evil network packets, and possibly evil servers.  So with
care we can probably allow for unprivileged mounts there.
