Alright, I think we can probably make it work without much/any changes
in kernel. So following what you said, we can just implement
PSCI_SYSTEM_RESET2 in firmware to enter the download mode having cookies
already set by default and the cookie is cleared when we have a normal
reboot via PSCI_SYSTEM_RESET. For panic reboot, we already have a 
cmdline
*reboot=panic_warm* to identify panic reboots and can call into
PSCI_SYSTEM_RESET2. I have just tested and it works fine if we have
psci_system_reset2_supported as true.

@Trilok/@Elliot, you can check if above works for your usecases in 
android
as well and it doesn't need any of your additional changes to kernel.

Thanks,
Sai
