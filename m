The comment do still need updating though. Its reference to thermal management
is cryptic. I couldn't see who performs hotplug operations in thermal code.

I also think generally that comment is no longer valid after the refactor I did
to 'prevent' in-kernel users from calling cpu_up/down() directly and force them
all to go via device_offline/online() which is wrapped via the add/remove_cpu()

	33c3736ec888 cpu/hotplug: Hide cpu_up/down()

So I think except for suspend/resume/hibernate/kexec, all in-kernel users
should be serialized by lock(hotplug) now. Since uevents() don't matter for
suspend/resume/hiberante/kexec I think moving it outside of lock(cpu_maps) is
fine.

So IIUC in the past we had the race

	userspace			in-kernel users

	lock(hotplug)
	cpuhp_smt_disable()
	   lock(cpu_maps)		cpu_down()
					  lock(cpu_maps)

So they were serialized by cpu_maps lock. But that should not happen now since
in-kernel (except for the aforementioned) users should use remove_cpu().

	userspace			in-kernel users

	lock(hotplug)
	cpuhp_smt_disable()
	   lock(cpu_maps)		remove_cpu()
					  lock(hotplug)
					  device_offline()
					    cpu_down()
					      lock(cpu_maps)

Which forces the serialization at lock(hotplug), which is what
lock_device_hotplug_sysfs() is actually tries to hold.

So I think that race condition should not happen now. Or did I miss something?

The only loophole is that cpu_device_up() could be abused if not caught by
reviewers. I didn't find a way to warn/error if someone other than
cpu_subsys_online() uses it. We rely on a comment explaining it..

I think cpuhp_smt_disable/enable can safely call device_offline/online now.
Although it might still be more efficient to hold lock(cpu_maps) once than
repeatedly in a loop.

If we do that, then cpu_up_down_serialize_trainwrech() can be called from
cpu_device_up/down() which implies !task_frozen.

Can't remember now if Alexey moved the uevent() handling out of the loop for
efficiency reasons or was seeing something else. I doubt it was the latter.
