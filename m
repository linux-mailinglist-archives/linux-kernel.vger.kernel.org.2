Subject: [PATCH] x86/sgx: SGX documentation fixes
Date:   Fri, 29 Oct 2021 10:49:56 -0700

SGX documentation fixes are:

 * Remove capitalization from regular words in the middle of a sentence.
 * Remove punctuation found in the middle of a sentence.
 * Fix name of SGX daemon to consistently be ksgxd.
 * Fix typo of SGX instruction: ENIT -> EINIT
