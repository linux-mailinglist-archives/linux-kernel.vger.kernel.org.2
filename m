Additionally if you dislike that method and prefer a different method 
explicitly stated by Congress:
By statutory law, an author can recover any copyrights signed away after 
(+-)30 years (US Copyright act).

The design of a program etc is a copyrightable aspect. RMS fixed this in 
form 30 years ago.
