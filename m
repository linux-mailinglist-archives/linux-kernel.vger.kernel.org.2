Hi Masami,

I agree. It was basically copying code from the histogram logic that
uses '.', and that's how it got mixed up. We should change it to be
more consistent.

I think the above is good. We can make it work with both '/' and '.'.

Would that work for you?

Good point.

Basically, we can not do:

  echo 'my_open pid_t pid; unsigned long file' > synthetic_events

  echo 'e:myopen_ret syscalls.sys_exit_open ret=$ret' > dynamic_events

  echo 'hist:keys=common_pid:file=filename' > events/syscalls/sys_enter_open/trigger
  echo 'hist:keys=common_pid:file=$file:onmatch(eprobes.myopen).trace(my_open,common_pid,$file)' > events/eprobes/myopen_ret

The above attaches a trace call to a synthetic event from the
myopen_ret event. The reason we do not allow it, is because we want
eprobes to attach to synthetic events (because they can convert the
types and do more to them), but we do not allow eprobes to attach to
eprobes. But if we allow synthetic events to attach to an eprobe, then
we can have:

 eprobe -> synthetic_event -> eprobe -> synthetic_event -> eprobe ...

Which can be dangerous, and hard to find loops.

Currently, we don't see any real use case to allow synthetic events to
attach to an eprobe, but if there is, we can change the code to allow
it, but we need to keep track of how many are attached, and limit them,
and we need to find a way to check for loops.

Thanks for your time at looking at this. We greatly appreciate it!
