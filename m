I think it depends on whether one wants to filter the MMIO access based
on the device, or based on the caller.

I would expect the cost of a bus access to always dwarf the cost of
indirect function calls and instrumentation. On the other hand,
the cost of an inline trace call is nontrivial in terms of code size,
which may lead to wasting significant amounts of both RAM and
instruction cache on small machines. If you want to continue with
your approach, it would help to include code size numbers before/after
for a defconfig kernel, and maybe some performance numbers to
show what this does when you enable tracing for all registers of
a device with a lot of accesses.

There is another point that I don't like in the implementation, which is
the extra indirection. If we end up with your approach of doing it
inline per caller, I would prefer having the instrumentation in
include/asm-generic/io.h, like

#ifndef readl
#define readl readl
static inline u32 readl(const volatile void __iomem *addr)
{
        u32 val;

        __io_br();
        val = __le32_to_cpu((__le32 __force)__raw_readl(addr));
        __io_ar(val);
        if (tracepoint_enabled(rwmmio_read))
               log_read_mmio("readl", addr, val);
        return val;
}
#endif

I think this would be a lot less confusing to readers, as it is implemented
exactly in the place that has the normal definition, and it can also have
somewhat more logical semantics by only instrumenting the
normal/relaxed/ioport accessors but not the __raw_* versions that
are meant to be little more than a pointer dereference.
