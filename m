I agree that exposing a NVMEM cell via sysfs does look as a generic 
functionality. However, the bootcount feature contains also a magic
value that needs to be taken in consideration when extracting the
bootcount value. The size of the field storing the magic and value combo
is configurable as well. The driver will handle this values 
transparentlry for the user and expose only the validated
bootcount value. In case we will only use a generic implementation for
exposing a NVMEM cell via sysfs the aformention functionality will have
to be handled by userspace and this will force the userspace to have
knolwdge about bootcount value format and magic since they will have
to implement it's own functionality about this. In the current solution
the user only have to reset the value to 0 and that's it, the driver
will take care of the rest.

Thanks for point this out. I will have a look how to fix this. I'll 
appriciate any advice.

I'll do that.

Sorry, my mistake. I will add it in the next patch-set.
