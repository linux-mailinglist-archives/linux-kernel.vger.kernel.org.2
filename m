Offtopic: We have some problems with this on newer Sony devices where
the BL indeed tries to overlay this DTBO on the DT, which is usually a
downstream DT not fitting on top of a mainline kernel+appended-DTB.  The
solution is to simply wipe DTBO, and afaik it should be fine to compile
the overlay bits directly inside the appended-DTB anyway.  Leads to
unsuspecting problems at times, but it is manageable.

Dmitry sees this as a problem for msm8974 but I'm not familiar enough
with the board.  I take it this doesn't use appended DTBs then?

Did the same on the v2 respin since it seems like those patches were
incomplete without the driver change.

Sent the msm8974 patch separately and re-spun a v2.  I haven't added the
.name="xo" fallback yet while awaiting Dmitry to see if that counts as
enough time for firmware to be delivered between kernel 5.15 and 5.16.
