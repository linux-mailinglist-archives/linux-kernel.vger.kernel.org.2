A suggestion, please put [GIT PULL] in your subject line, so that I know
what this is for, that's a semi-standard thing these days.

Also, you have a number of patches in this set that look like they
should be backported to stable kernels.  Any reason why you did not tag
them with a "Cc: stable@..." tag in the commit?  After they are merged
into Linus's tree, please send the git ids of the commits that should go
to stable kernels to stable@vger.kernel.org so that we can add them
properly.

Now pulled and pushed out, thanks.

thanks,

greg k-h
