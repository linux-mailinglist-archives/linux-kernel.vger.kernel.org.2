It's true but it couldn't be justication to allocate objects from any
migration type. We should try to select right type. Please see below.

You shouldn't rely on how many pages the slab has since it's internal
implemenation and zspage size also could be changed in the future.
And please think about external fragmentaion as well as internal one.

What we want to try with allocation type is to group similar lifetime
objects together in a pageblock group to help external fragmentation
for high-order allocation. Think what happens if the unreclaimable
object is located in a reclaimable pageblock. The block couldn't be
merged into high-order page in the end so it causes more compaction
and smaller available high-order pages in the system.
