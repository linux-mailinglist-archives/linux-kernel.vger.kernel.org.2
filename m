Do we have a list of the affected systems?

That would be the best thing to do, and would make the machine fully
usable. I still think we need to have something in the kernel to at
least let the user know that their system is misconfigured though.

If CFE allows a payload to be loaded at EL3 and executed on all CPUs,
that would be absolutely awesome. It would even allow switching over
to ATF...

Without deviation from the norm, progress is not possible.
