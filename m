This is basically a cgroup interface for the existing MPOL_MF_LAZY /
MPOL_F_MOF flags, which are per task (set_mempolicy()) and per-vma
(mbind()) scope respectively. They're not per-node, so cannot be
cgroupified through cpuset's node restrictions alone, and I understand
why a cgroup interface could be convenient.

On the other hand, this is not really about configuring a shared
resource. Rather it's using cgroups to set an arbitrary task parameter
on a bunch of tasks simultaneously. It's the SIMD type usecase of
cgroup1 that we tried to get away from in cgroup2, simply because it's
so unbounded in scope. There are *a lot* of possible task parameters,
and we could add a lot of kernel interfaces that boil down to
css_task_iter and setting or clearing a task flag.

So I'm also thinking this cgroup interface isn't desirable.

If you want to control numa policies of tasks from the outside, it's
probably best to extend the numa syscall interface to work on pids.
And then use cgroup.procs to cgroupify the operation from userspace.

Or extend the NUMA interface to make the system-wide default behavior
configurable, so that you can set MPOL_F_MOF in there (without having
to enable autonuma).

But yeah, cgroups doesn't seem like the right place to do this.

Thanks
