Will do.

Sure, I will look at parsing the address from DT manually at init time.

The reason I don't think this is that complicated is that that is what 
cboot is already passing to the kernel. Maybe we could support both 
options since it's just 2 or 3 extra lines.

Will look into integrating this into tegra-tcu.c.
