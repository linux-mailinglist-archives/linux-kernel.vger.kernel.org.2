I do not see any page lock enforecement there. There is not even a
comment requiring that. Can we grow more users where this is not the
case? There is no actual relation between alloc_page_buffers and
get_mem_cgroup_from_page except that the former is the only _current_
existing user. I would be careful to dictate locking based solely on
that.

I do not remember details and the changelog of that change is not
explicit but I suspect it was just because this one could trigger as
there are external callers to memcg. Is this protection needed? I am not
sure, this is for you to justify if you want to remove it.

Please state your reasoning in the changelog including benefits we get
from it.
