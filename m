This is rather complicated.

For most (msm8916) devices it works with a region from dma_alloc but
there are at least three devices where it causes problems.

If the region was allocated by dma_alloc (somewhere near 0xfe100000
if I remember correctly) then
- Wileyfox Swift (Longcheer L8150): Location service "crashes"
  (repeats request every 10-ish seconds while location session is
  open and gives no location data)
- Samsung A3, A5: The entire modem crashes after it gets the response
  with such address.

Downstream kernel allocates the region at slightly different address
which works fine.

It's probably possible to change the allocation address with dma mask
but I have no idea why the crash happens on those devices, if it's
even possible to debug this or find all the "bad" regions.
Because of that I prefer using a known-good address at least for the
location client that keeps it forever.

I'm having a hard time imagining how this would be implemented...

Assuming that I need to keep reserved-memory for some clients
and other clients will need proper dynamic allocation (maybe on a
newer platform), there will be an optional subnode in each remoteproc
node, that will be detected by the remoteproc driver which will then
start memshare. It will have all the id-s, size or phandle to
reserved-memory. Then there may be multiple of those in one
remoteproc. Or one memshare subnode will contain multiple client
nodes? Then if I understand correctly, there are multiple different
remoteproc drivers so each will have to be modified. They will need
to spawn only one memshare instance and pass the clients to it.
Or maybe the subnode can contain a compatible and the code to keep
only one instance will be in the memshare driver itself...

To be honest, I'm getting very confused by even trying to lay this
down in my mind. I think it just unnecessarily complicates both
binding and the driver to "hide" it's nodes through the device tree.

Maybe I just didn't understand the proposal...
