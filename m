Attention please,
This is to bring to your kind attention that the World Bank in
affiliation with the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has
sanctioned the Government of concerned countries to compensate the
scam victims, including those that lost money on unsuccessful
contracts and transactions in Africa. Each of the victims will be
compensated with the sum of $2.5 Million dollars, to ensure that
justice is served. This is necessitated by numerous reports of scams
perpetuated from some African countries. There have been reports that
the victims have lost billions of dollars to the scammers.


However, your details were obtained from one of the scammers who were
recently arrested by the joint security operatives comprising
INTERPOL, FBI and local security. The culprit confessed that there are
other partners in crime, and the security agents are tracking them for
possible arrest. Therefore, you are hereby advised to keep this
information confidential until all the scammers are apprehended.


Contact the payment manager now for your compensation payment. Note,
your payment reference number is: CP005698BFA. Quote or better use
your payment reference number as subject when contacting the payment manager.


Payment manager: Mr. Johnbosco Lapa O.
Email: alphn22448@gmail.com
Tel: +2266572579


Yours faithfully,
John Leach
The secretary of the FINANCIAL ACTION TASK FORCE
