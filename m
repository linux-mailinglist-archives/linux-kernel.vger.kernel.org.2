The communication using a rpmsg_chrdev should be happening in two different ways,
i.e RPMSG_CREATE_EPT_IOCTL and RPMSG_CREATE_DEV_IOCTL (as you had in a previous
patchset). 

From user space communication using a rpmsg_chrdev should be initiated in two
different ways, i.e RPMSG_CREATE_EPT_IOCTL and RPMSG_CREATE_DEV_IOCTL (as you
had in a previous patchset). 

Regarding RPMSG_CREATE_EPT_IOCTL, patches 1, 2 and 3 take care of the legacy
compatibility and I am quite happy with that.  In this case the driver works the
same way regardless of the transport mechanism - virtio, GLINK or SMD.

Then there is instantiation with RPMSG_CREATE_DEV_IOCTL.  That creates a new
channel (with endpoint) when coming from /dev/rpmsg_ctrlX.  When we have that
functionality we can make the rpmsg_chrdev available from the name service, making
sure the end result is the same regardless of source of the request (remote
processor or user space).  I was under the impression that functionality would
be part of an upcoming patchset.

Unless I'm missing parts of the story, proceeding this way should cover all the
requirements we talked about.

Introducing RPMSG_TTY makes sense if a serial controller is only accessible from
the remote processor.  On the flip side it is an overkill if we just want a raw
message passing mechanism.  For that the rpmsg_chrdev driver, with the above
extention, should be used.
