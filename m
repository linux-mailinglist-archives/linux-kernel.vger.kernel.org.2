Ok, I see what you mean now, sorry for being dense. If we allow this then
there is a need to add a special value that means all/many states (such as
-1 or something such) so that a mux-control can be used simultaneously by
drivers "pointing at" a specific state like you want to do, and by the
existing "application" style drivers that wraps the whole mux control.

I.e. something like this

	mux: mux {
		compatible = "mux-gpio";
		...

		#mux-control-cells = <1>; /* one more than previously */
	};

	phy {
		...

		mux-control = <&mux 3>; /* point to specific state */
	};

	i2c-mux {
		compatible = "i2c-mux-gpmux";
		parent = <&i2c0>
		mux-control = <&mux (-1)>; /* many states needed */

		...

		i2c@1 {
			eeprom@50 {
				...
			};
		};

		i2c@2 {
			...
		};
	};

Yes, I realize that accesses to the eeprom cannot happen if the mux is
constantly selected and locked in state 3 by the phy, and that a mux with
one channel being a phy and other channels being I2C might not be
realistic, but the same gpio lines might control several muxes that are
used for separate signals solving at least the latter "problem" with this
completely made up example. Anyway, the above is in principle, and HW
designs are sometimes too weird for words.

Changing that would require a bindings update anyway, so I simply
disallowed it as an error. Not much thought went into the decision,
as it couldn't be wrong to do what is being done with the bindings
that exist. That said, I have no problem lifting this restriction,
if there's a matching bindings update that makes it all fit.

It need not be one grand unifying phy mux, it could be one for each
kind of phy interface. But again, I don't know much about how phys
work nor their interfaces, not event roughly how many drivers there
are etc etc. I have simply never needed to look.

Hmm, wild idea, maybe there could be a mux "application" for pinctrl?
I mean such that you could tie pinctrl states to mux states. It doesn't
sound like too bad of a match to me?
