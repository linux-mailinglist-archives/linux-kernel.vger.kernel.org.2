Maybe we should use the descriptive part of the hcall.

So H_GET_ENERGY_SCALE_INFO -> ../papr/energy_scale_info/

That should help avoid any naming confusion, because every hcall should
have a unique name.

In future if there's ever a H_GET_ENERGY_SCALE_INFO_2 we would then have
to decide if we expose that as a separate directory, or more likely we
would handle that in the kernel and continue to use the existing sysfs
name.

Yeah that seems reasonable.

I'd think we should just omit the value_desc if it's empty.

cheers
