I thought that just the channel ID wouldn't be very useful for locating where the
issue is when doing --dump-raw-trace.

By printing "Idx:..." it can be pasted straight into the search in perf and you'll
jump straight to the part where the error happened. If you only have the channel
ID then you'd still need to get a debugger out and find out the index if you want
to look into the problem.

I will include the index in the new patch I will submit now, but I don't insist on
keeping it so let me know what you think.
