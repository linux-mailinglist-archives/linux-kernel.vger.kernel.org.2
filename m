Would it be technically possible to do the following: Based on the
downstream report we receved in Debian in
https://bugs.debian.org/988574 wrap up the same patch (I guess I will
need to use another commit message wording) and resubmit with my own
SoB with my downstream hat on and say a Tested-by from Vagrant? So we
are not blocked on the SoB issue from this original post of the change
to apply to arch/arm/boot/dts/sun8i-h3-orangepi-plus.dts ?

Regards,
Salvatore
