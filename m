I am concerned about starting anything "synchronize_rcu" if that
thing doesn't unconditionally wait for a grace period.  "What do
you mean that there was no grace period?  Don't you see that call to
synchronize_rcu_poll_start_raw()???"

This objection doesn't apply to cond_synchronize_rcu(), but it is
already in use, so any name change should be worked with the users.
All two of them.  ;-)

You mean this sequence of events?

1.	cookie = start_poll_synchronize_rcu()

2.	The grace period corresponding to cookie is almost over...

3.	cond_synchronize_rcu() checks the cookie and sees that the
	grace period has not yet expired.

4.	The grace period corresponding to cookie completes.

5.	Someone else starts a grace period.

6.	cond_synchronize_rcu() invokes synchronize_rcu(), which waits
	for the just-started grace period plus another grace period.
	Thus, there has been no fewer than three full grace periods
	between the call to start_poll_synchronize_rcu() and the
	return from cond_synchronize_rcu().

Yes, this can happen!  And it can be worse, for example, it is quite
possible that cond_synchronize_rcu() would be preempted for multiple
grace periods at step 5, in which case it would still wait for almost
two additional grace periods.

Or are you thinking of something else?

How about like this?

/**
 * poll_state_synchronize_rcu - Conditionally wait for an RCU grace period
 *
 * @oldstate: return from call to get_state_synchronize_rcu() or start_poll_synchronize_rcu()
 *
 * If a full RCU grace period has elapsed since the earlier call from
 * which oldstate was obtained, return @true, otherwise return @false.
 * If @false is returned, it is the caller's responsibilty to invoke this
 * function later on until it does return @true.  Alternatively, the caller
 * can explicitly wait for a grace period, for example, by passing @oldstate
 * to cond_synchronize_rcu() or by directly invoking synchronize_rcu().
 *
 * Yes, this function does not take counter wrap into account.
 * But counter wrap is harmless.  If the counter wraps, we have waited for
 * more than 2 billion grace periods (and way more on a 64-bit system!).
 * Those needing to keep oldstate values for very long time periods
 * (many hours even on 32-bit systems) should check them occasionally
 * and either refresh them or set a flag indicating that the grace period
 * has completed.

Thank you, I will apply it at the next rebase.
