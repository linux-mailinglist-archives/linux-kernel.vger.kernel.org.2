Validate can only remove features, or? So I guess after validate
is a subset of before validate.

Well that is what we are talking about. One can try to infer things from
the spec. This reset dance I called ugly is probably the cleanest,
because the spec says that re-nego should work.

I agree! But that regression really hurts us. Maybe the best band-aid is
to conditional-compile it (not compile the check if s390).

No it does not, but I hope, the implementations we care the most about do
little endian if VERSION_1 is set but FEATURES_OK is not yet done. A
transitional device would have to act upon a feature that is set,
because for legacy there is no FEATURES_OK. Where we can run into
trouble is minimum required feature set, e.g. mandatory features.

I will do some testing.

I tend to agree. What I didn't consider in this patch is that, setting
bits does not only set bits, but may also change the device in a way,
that clearing the bit would not change it back.

I agree.

I didn't quite get it. Would this hack take place in QEMU or in the guest
kernel?

There is the conditional compile, as an option but I would not say it is
better.
