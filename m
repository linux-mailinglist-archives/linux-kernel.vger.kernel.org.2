I'm suggesting that if we're replacing the container/group model with
an ioasid then we're effectively creating a new thing that really only
retains the vfio device uapi.

David Gibson has argued for some time that SPAPR could be handled via a
converged type1 model.  We has mapped that out at one point,
essentially a "type2", but neither of us had any bandwidth to pursue it.

Right, but I don't see that implies it cannot work within the vfio
IOMMU model.  Currently when an IOMMU is set, the /dev/vfio/vfio
container becomes a conduit for file ops from the container to be
forwarded to the IOMMU.  But that's in part because the user doesn't
have another object to interact with the IOMMU.  It's entirely possible
that with an ioasid shim, the user would continue to interact directly
with the /dev/ioasid fd for IOMMU manipulation and only use
VFIO_SET_IOMMU to associate a vfio container to that ioasid.

As above, we don't necessarily need to have the vfio container be the
access mechanism for the IOMMU, it can become just an means to
association the container with an IOMMU.  This has quite a few
transitional benefits.

This is where we've dissolved all but the vfio device uapi, which
suggests the group and container model were never necessary and I'm not
sure exactly what that uapi looks like.  We currently make use of an
IOMMU api that is group aware, but that awareness extends out to the
vfio uapi.

vfio really just wants to be able to attach groups to an address space
to consider them isolated, everything else about the IOMMU API could
happen via a new ioasid file descriptor representing that context, ie.
vfio handles the group ownership and device access, ioasid handles the
actual mappings.

I'm afraid /dev/ioasid providing type1 compatibility would be just that.

The container represents an IOMMU address space, which can be shared by
multiple groups, where each group may contain one or more devices.
Swapping a container would require releasing all the devices (the user
cannot have access to a non-isolated device), then a group could be
moved from one container to another.

Sounds like a group...  Note also that if those other devices are not
isolated from the user's device, the user could manipulate "unused"
devices via DMA.  So even unused devices should be within the same
IOMMU context... thus attaching groups to IOMMU domains.

What tools does userspace have to understand isolation of individual
devices without groups?

The group concept is explicit today because how does userspace learn
about implicit dependencies between devices?  For example, if the user
has a conventional PCI bus with a couple devices on it, how do they
understand that those devices cannot be assigned to separate userspace
drivers?  The group fd fills that gap.  Thanks,
