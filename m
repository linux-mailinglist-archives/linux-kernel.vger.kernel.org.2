Can it go away physically or just in software?

Usually the pattern is that you make sure in the device driver that nobody
can orphan the MTD while it is in use.
e.g. drivers/mtd/ubi/gluebi.c does so. In _get_device() it grabs a reference on the
underlying UBI volume to make sure it cannot go away while the MTD (on top of UBI)
is in use.

Thanks,
