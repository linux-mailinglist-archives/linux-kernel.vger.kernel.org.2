Hi Michael,

so the virtbt_{open,close} as NOP is not really what a driver is suppose
to be doing. These are transport enable/disable callbacks from the BT
Core towards the driver. It maps to a device being enabled/disabled by
something like bluetoothd for example. So if disabled, I expect that no
resources/queues are in use.

Maybe I misunderstand the virtio spec in that regard, but I would like
to keep this fundamental concept of a Bluetooth driver. It does work
with all other transports like USB, SDIO, UART etc.

There should be no buffer used if the device is powered off. We also donâ€™t
have any USB URBs in-flight if the transport is not active.

In the virtbt_close() callback we should deactivate all interrupts.
