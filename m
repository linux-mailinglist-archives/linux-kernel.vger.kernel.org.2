Yes, dealing with the warning in some way is my only motivation. My
apologies, I should have led with that. I had assumed that this would
potentially be an issue due to the warning's text and that rearranging
the structure might allow the alignment to be added back but if there is
not actually a problem, then the warning should be silenced in some way.

I am not sure if there is a preferred way to silence it (CFLAGS_... or
some of the __diag() infrastructure in include/linux/compiler_types.h).
