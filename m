VEC also is pretty incorrect: there is code at those addresses, not
vectors pointing to code (as similar things on some other architectures
have).  Everyone understands what it means of course, except it is
confusing with a thing we *do* have on Power called VEC (the MSR bit) :-P

(And TRAP is just one cause of 700...)
