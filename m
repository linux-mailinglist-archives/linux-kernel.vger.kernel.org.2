Agreed, the commit message needs more details.

No judgement, RHEL is similar.  Linux is nothing if not pragmatic.

Well, that's cool.  I had no idea.

I'm curious how they're generating livepatch modules?  Because
kpatch-build doesn't support Clang (AFAIK), and if they're not using
kpatch-build then there are some traps to look out for.

I agree 100%, if there are actual Clang livepatch users (which it sounds
like there are) then we should target both compilers.

And yes, objtool has been pretty good at finding compiler bugs, so the
more coverage the better.

I like the -fno-jump-tables suggestion, assuming it doesn't affect
performance significantly.

Objtool is generic in many ways -- in fact I recently heard from a PhD
candidate who used it successfully on another kernel for an ORC
unwinder.

It could probably be used on user space without much effort.  That was
an early original stated goal but I definitely don't have the bandwidth
or incentive to work on it.

Thanks, I'll write something up (maybe a more specific proposal) and
post it.
