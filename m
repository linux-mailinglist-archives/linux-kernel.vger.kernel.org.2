I do some test, and you are right. I am so surprised that the product
does not extended and the overflowed result is 0. Thank you for letting
me know this, and I correct my mistaken concept not too late :-)

If you want me to take this patch, it is OK to me. I will have it in
v5.12. If you want to handle this patch to upstream in your track, you
may have my

Thanks for your patient explaining.

I know the above things, but I DO NOT know product of two 32bit values
multiplying does not extend to 64bit. Good to know the compiling is not
that smart.

Thank you!
