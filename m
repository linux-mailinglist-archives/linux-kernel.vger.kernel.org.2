A. I would not mind if it was already merged. Since it isn't, I don't
   see the point not fixing it.

B. I need to maintain this, once it's merged.
C. A smaller diff for a critical bug fix. I actually allow style
   compromises for fixes to be backported *when* it makes the overall
   diff smaller.
D. Has more odds to make future changes smaller as the whole thing is
   in a single code line.

For me it gives a framework to review patches in multiple subsystems.
If I have to constantly think whether to allow this and that shift
from the kernel coding style, it makes the whole process for me more
fuzzy and chaotic.

As I said (A), it would not be end of the world if this had been
merged already. I also want to state that I do sometimes make mistakes
when reviewing code, and am happy to take critique from that :-)
