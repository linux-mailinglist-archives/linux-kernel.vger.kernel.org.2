Right but we won't know until we profile the specific usecases or try 
them
in generic workload to see if they affect the performance. Sure, over
invalidation is a concern where multiple buffers can be mapped to same 
context
and the cache is not usable at the time for lookup and such but we don't 
do it
for small buffers and only for large buffers which means thousands of 
TLB entry
mappings in which case TLBIASID is preferred (note: I mentioned the HW 
team
recommendation to use it for anything greater than 128 TLB entries) in 
my earlier
reply. And also note that we do this only for partial walk flush, we are 
not
arbitrarily changing all the TLBIs to ASID based.

I am no camera expert but from what the camera team mentioned is that
there is a thread which frees memory(large unused memory buffers)
periodically which ends up taking around 100+ms and causing some camera 
test
failures with frame drops. Parallel efforts are already being made to 
optimize
this usage of thread but as I mentioned previously, this is *not a 
camera
specific*, lets say someone else invokes such large unmaps, it's going 
to face
the same issue.

Not sure I understand what you mean by queuing on background thread but 
with
that or not, we still do the same number of TLBIs and hop through
iommu->io-pgtable->arm-smmu to perform the the unmap, so how will that 
help?

Thanks,
Sai
