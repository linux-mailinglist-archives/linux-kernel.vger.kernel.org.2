Yeah, there doesn't seem to be a lot of consistency with the ordering
of Chinese names when they are written in Roman characters.  Some
people put the family name first, and other people will put the
personal (first) name first.  In some cases it may be because the
developer in question is living in America, and so they've decided to
use the American naming convention.  (Two example of this are former
ext4 developers Mingming Cao and Jiaying Zhang, who live in Portland
and Los Angelos, and their family names are Cao and Zhang,
respectively.)

My personal opinion is people should use whatever name they are
comfortable with, using whatever characters they prefer.  The one
thing that would be helpful for me is for people to give a hint about
how they would prefer to be called --- for example, would you prefer
that start an e-mail with the salutation, "Hi Gao", "Hi Xiang", or "Hi
Gao Xiang"?

And if I don't know, and I guess wrong, please feel free to correct
me, either privately, or publically on the e-mail list, if you think
it would be helpful for more people to understand how you'd prefer to
be called.

Cheers,
