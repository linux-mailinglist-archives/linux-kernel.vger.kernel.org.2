Who has objected to xrt/ being the only new subdirectory?

My main complaints here are:
	- these patches were not tested
	- you renamed kernel modules "accidentally"
	- you forgot SPDX lines
	- lack of description of why these files being moved was
	  necessary in the changelog where you moved the files

Remember, patch 0/X never shows up in changelogs...

You can do better :)
