There are multiple things going on here:

- The aliases are traditionally managed by the bootloader, same way
   as the /chosen nodes including the kernel command line, so the
   numbers are local policy, and the per-board defaults are just
   for convenience.

- IMHO there should not be any aliases for status="disabled"
  nodes, and the status is usually set in the board files.

- The labels on the board don't always match what the SoC calls
  them, or there might not be any labels at all. This is more
  important for things like serial ports that are often bare
  connectors rather than already wired up. The aliases should
  normally match how the board numbers the connectors, not
  how they are attached internally.

- For i2c, it's not uncommon to have i2c devices attached behind
  expanders on i2c/spi/gpio/usb/pci devices
