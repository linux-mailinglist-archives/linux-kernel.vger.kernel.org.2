Yes i could, but this will break a concept of the rpmsg_char that creates the
endpoint on open, meaning that application is ready to communicate.

I would rather preserve this behavior.

In qcom_glink_create_chrdev, a rpmsg_ctrl rpdev with a default endpoint is
created and used as parameter of the  pmsg_ctrldev_register_device [1]
=> rpdev->ept is not NULL.

So the rpmsg_char has to differentiate 2 cases on rpmsg_eptdev_open:
- A enpdoint has to be created as requested by RPMSG_CREATE_EPT_IOCTL
(regardless of the rpdev->ept value)
- for a rpmsg device created by an NS announcement: A default endpoint has to be
reused (or created if rpdev->ept is null).

so the rpdev->ept test is not relevant for decision, the use_default_ept ( or
another flag) is mandatory.
