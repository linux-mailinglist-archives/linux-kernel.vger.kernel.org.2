Although I reviewed this patch, I think we should drop it from this
series and restart the discussion with the Chromium guys on what/if they
need PROT_MTE with MAP_SHARED. It currently breaks if you have two
PROT_MTE mappings but if they are ok with only one of the mappings being
PROT_MTE, I'm happy to just document it.

Not sure whether subsequent patches depend on it though.
