If we add this for all events, it would require a lot of changes to all
users of tracepoints, as it would require adding a new parameter to the
callbacks.

We could add a flag in the registering that states that the callback is OK
for it, and it passes that data as well.

Let me look into this for a bit. I may not have something this week, but
we should look into this more before adding little hacks that do this one
at a time like this patch.
