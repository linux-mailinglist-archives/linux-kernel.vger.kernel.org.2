I'm really not sure what "anything special" would constitute here.

Um.. is there a sane way to return strings from an ioctl()?

It's not the fact that the device fds are spawed from the group fd.
It's the fact that the "attach" operation - binding the group to the
container now, binding the whatever to the iosasid in future -
explicitly takes a group.  That's an operation that affects a group,
so the interface should reflect that.

Getting the device fds from the group fd kind of follows, because it's
unsafe to do basically anything on the device unless you already
control the group (which in this case means attaching it to a
container/ioasid).  I'm entirely open to ways of doing that that are
less inelegant from a sysfs integration point of view, but the point
is you must manage the group before you can do anything at all with
individual devices.

I don't see why.  I mean, sure, you don't want explicitly the *vfio*
group as such.  But IOMMU group is already a cross-subsystem concept
and you can explicitly expose that in a different way.

If you don't have a group concept in other subsystems, there's a fair
chance they are broken.  There are a bunch of operations that are
inherently per-group.  Well.. per container/IOASID, but the
granularity of membership for that is the group.

Again, I realy think this is necessary complexity.  You're right that
far too little of the userspace properly understands group
restrictions.. but these come from real hardware limitations, and I
don't feel like making it *less* obvious in the interface is going to
help that.
