I'll admit that I had missed your initial submission, but having
looked at it, while I could imagine some nits where it could be
improved, in my opinion, it's strictly better than the older
reporting-bugs doc.

Is there anyone following this thread who believes that there is
anything we should change *before* oficially blessing
reporting-issues.rst?  Given that Konstantin has already linked to
reporting-issues from the front page of kernel.bugzilla.org, I think
we we should just go ahead and officially bless it and be done with
it.   :-)

Once it is blessed, I'd also suggest putting a link to
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/reporting-issues.html
as an "other resources" at https://www.kernel.org.
