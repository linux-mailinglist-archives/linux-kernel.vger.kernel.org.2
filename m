Having a per-thread queue has some benefits which are very useful in our case:
 - it should be able to scale to bigger machines than a shared queue (looking at
both tests from jiri, it looks like this version is somewhat better than v2, but
they're done in different conditions, so some other tests comparing the two
versions on big machines would be useful).
 - it is possible to choose the worker to execute work on, which is used in the
evlist patchset (where threads can be pinned to a cpu and evlist operations can
be done on them).

Of course, it adds some complexity over the shared queue, for example:
 - the next_worker pointer to implement the round-robin policy, for which maybe
there's a cleaner way to do it.
 - the thread "self-registration", which I think can be dropped in favor of an
array inside the workqueue (the max number of threads is limited, so having a
self-registration does not really add much flexibility and it adds contention on
the workqueue lock when threads are spun-up). Getting rid of it could reduce
workqueue spinup and stop time.

Riccardo
