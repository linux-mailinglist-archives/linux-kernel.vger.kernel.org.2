A similar statement is in the ARMv8 ARM (E2.2.1 in version G.a).

Indeed. We should assume that the SDRAM supports all the CPU features.

The above statement does say "translation table walks and accesses to
translation tables". The accesses can be LDRD/STRD instructions from
other CPUs. Since the hardware can't tell whether the access is to a
page table, the designers just made LDRD/STRD single-copy atomic.

That's my understanding as well. In theory one could have a page table
access from EL0, so it should be atomic.

We could try to clarify E2.2.1 to simply state that naturally aligned
LDRD/STRD are single-copy atomic without any subsequent statement on the
translation table.
