Yeah, i did test as following steps
hostA                        hostB
    mount
      ext4_multi_mount_protect  -> seq == EXT4_MMP_SEQ_CLEAN
         delay 5s after label "skip" so hostB will see seq is 
EXT4_MMP_SEQ_CLEAN
                        mount
                        ext4_multi_mount_protect -> seq == 
EXT4_MMP_SEQ_CLEAN
                                run  kmmpd
     run kmmpd

Actuallyï¼Œin this  situation kmmpd will not detect  confliction.
In  ext4_multi_mount_protect  function we write mmp data fisrt and wait 
'wait_time * HZ'  seconds,
read mmp data do check.Most of the time, If 'wait_time' is zero, it can 
pass check.
