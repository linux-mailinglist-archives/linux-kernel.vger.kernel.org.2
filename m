Hi, I have some general comments and questions, mostly trying to
understand design of the hcall and use cases of the sysfs data:

Instead of logical address, guest address or guest physical address
would be more precise.

The offset is from the start of the buffer, isn't it? So not the array
offset.

Is this new hypercall already present in the spec? These seem a bit
underspecified to me.

Hm.. Maybe this should be something less generic than "papr"?

So the hypervisor could simply not send the string representation? How
will the userspace tell the difference since they are reading everything
from a file?

Overall I'd say we should give the data in a more structured way and let
the user-facing tool do the formatting and presentation.

How do we keep a stable interface with userspace? Say the hypervisor
decides to add or remove attributes, change their order, string
representation, etc? It will inform us via the version field, but that
is lost when we output this to sysfs.

I get that if the userspace just iterate over the contents of the
directory then nothing breaks, but there is not much else it could do it
seems.
