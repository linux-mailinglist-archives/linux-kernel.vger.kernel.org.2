This looks like it's controlled by udev?Â  Have a default per bus, and 
let user space override it before setting up the device.

This doesn't help us handle builtin drivers that initialize before user 
space is up.

We need something that works for all drivers. Also cannot just use a 
default at bootup because some drivers (like virtio or rtc) need to be 
initialized in early boot to make the system functional at all. So you 
need a way to distinguish these two cases in the pre user space boot.

That's basically what this patch implements the infrastructure for.

How would such a proposal work for a platform driver that doesn't have a 
bus?
