FWIW, just sent out a new series that IMHO at least is a small step in
the right direction:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-doc/cover.1616181657.git.linux@leemhuis.info/

Hard to see in the diffs, might be wise to look at the end result.

I added this patch to the series as things otherwise might get hard to
handle.

In the latest patch (
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-doc/652ee20eb36228f5d7ca842299faa4cb472feedb.1616181657.git.linux@leemhuis.info/
) I removed most of the quoting. I didn't touch other parts of the file
for now. Waiting for an option on this and then will address it in a
septate patch in one go.
