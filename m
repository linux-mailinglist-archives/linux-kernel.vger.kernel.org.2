Michal,

Let's take an extreme case where memcg 1 always generate the
first event and memcg 2 generates the rest of 128*8-1 events
and the pattern repeat.  The update tree happens on the 128*8th event
so memcg 1 did not trigger update tree.  In this case we will
keep missing memcg 1's event and not put memcg 1 on the tree.

Something like this pattern of memory events


cg1 cg2 cg2 cg2 ....cg2 cg1 cg2 cg2 cg2....cg2 cg1 cg2 .....
                     ^                      ^
		  update tree              update tree

Of course in real life the update events are random in nature.
However, due to the low occurrence of memcg 1 event, we can miss
updating it for a long time due to its lower probability of occurrence.

I think there are two limits because the original code wants
memc_cgroup_threshold to be updated more frequently than the
soft_limit_tree.  The soft limit tree update is more costly.
