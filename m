Hi Ulf!

Thank you for your comments!

Yes, that's correct. The problem we have seen is triggered by ioctls.

Yes, we have tried that, and it does trigger a power cycle, making the card
operational again. But as it requires an operator to trigger it, I thought
it might be something that could be automated here. At least once.

Yes, that is a valid point, and that is why the power cycle is only tried
once. But the conditon for this reset is a -ETIMEDOUT, and this is the part of
this patch where I am myself not sure of if it is enough to check for. Would
this be an error that you could expect to happen with ioctl requests in other
situations also, but not necessarily cause by a stalled card?

Kind regards
