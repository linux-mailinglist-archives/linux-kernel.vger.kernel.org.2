Have you tried to isolate those workloads by memory cgroups? That could
help for lru lock at least. You are likely going to hit other locks on
the way though. E.g. zone lock in the page allocator but that might be
less problematic in the end. If you isolate your long running services
to a different NUMA node then you can get even less interaction.

It will be hard and a constant fight to get reasonably low latencies on
a non preemptible kernel. It would likely be better to partition CPUs
between latency sensitive and BE jobs. I can see how that might not be
really practical but especially with non-preemptible kernels you have a
large space for priority inversions that is hard to forsee or contain.
