The lower-level driver is, of course, clear what it is doing. And the
FPGA Image Load Framework simply provides a consistent API and manages
a potentially long-running data transfer in the context of a kernel
worker thread.

It sounds like you are saying that that is not "clear enough" in the
context of the FPGA Manager?

The files that are used with Intel PAC devices are self-describing. The
user-space tools, the class driver and the lower-level driver just pass
the data through to the card BMC without any knowledge of the content,
purpose or final destination of the data.

The card BMC will receive signed data, validate it, and process it as a
BMC image, an FPGA image, a Root Entry Hash, or a key cancellation. In
the n6000, it could also be part of a multi-step process for programming
SDM keys and the data may not be stored permanently.

I'm not sure what you mean by "feed the data to any engine undefined by the
framework". I think the "engine" is the lower level driver/device that invokes
the fpga_mgr. The lower level driver, of course, is clear what it is doing.
The fpga_mgr cannot control what driver invokes it.

Are saying that when invoking the fpga-mgr, that it _must_ also pass descriptive
data. Meaning that a self-describing file alone is not acceptable?

>>> FPGA nvmem update could be a standalone fpga-mgr.
>>>
>>> Extra APIs that are unique to nvmem update
>>> ==========================================
>>>
>>>   cdev APIs for nvmem update:
>>>     Yes we need to expand the functionality so we need them.
>>>
>>>   available_images, image_load APIs for loading nvmem content to FPGA
>>>   region:
>>>     These are features in later patchsets which are not submitted, but we
>>>     could talk about it in advance. I think this is actually a FPGA region
>>>     update from nvmem, it also requires gating, data loading (no SW transfer)
>>>     and re-enumeration, or a single command to image_load HW may result system
>>>     disordered. The FPGA framework now only supports update from in-kernel
>>>     user data, maybe we add support for update from nvmem later.
>>>
>>>   fpga-mgr state extend:
>>>     I think it could be extended, The current states are not perfect,
>>>     adding something like IDLE or READY is just fine.
>>>
>>>   fpga-mgr status extend:
>>>     Add general error definitions as needed. If there is some status
>>>     that is quite vendor specific, expose it in low-level driver.
>>>
>>>   remaining-size:
>>>     Nice to have for all.
>>>
>>> Threading the update
>>> ====================
>>>
>>>   Also a good option for FPGA region update, maybe we also have a slow FPGA
>>>   reprogrammer?
>>>
>>> Cancelling the update
>>> ====================
>>>
>>>   Also a good option for FPGA region update if HW engine supports.
>> These are all good points.
