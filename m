Yeah, one is enough. My guess would be that it is more visible on the
small ones because on the bigger ones it is more likely that the thread
gets migrated to another core.

So for the 1/2 core it should make no difference if you use an RTmutex
instead. For the bigger ones it might not be optimal.

My guess here is that most people don't use RT priorities and don't see
this problem _or_ they have enough cores. Or they simply don't use that
way.

From PREEMPT_RT perspective, rwsem/rwlock used to be single-reader until
late 3.x or early 4.x series (I don't remember exactly when it changed).
Boosting multiple readers was tried once but didn't really work. 
PREEMPT_RT has also this problem where multiple low-prio reader can
block the high-prio writer but fortunately most critical rwsem users
moved to RCU so it is not much of problem.
