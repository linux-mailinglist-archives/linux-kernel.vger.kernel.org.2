Yes, the top 4 bytes get trimmed off as an index, then it's a big blob
to all places except eBPF (when asking for the iterator directly).

Largely, yes.

The optimization part of the patch moves the buffer copies into the
probes to remove a double copy. I believe however that output can be
checked either centrally before the probes or within each probe call if
need be.

For perf/eBPF we may not need to check things, however, for ftrace
we will due to the filters. So we may be able to isolate to just the
ftrace probe method.

The ftrace probe will have a blob even after optimization due to the copy
into the ring buffer (assuming we can discard it if it violates a policy).

We really need to ensure that data can be analyzed on the machine
directly (eBPF, ftrace, perf) as well as outside of the machine (ftrace, perf).

The priorities to us are fast recording speed with accurate reading of trace
files and event data.
