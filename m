Thanks Johan, will keep this in mind in all my future patches.

Taking the subject as suggested by you for the current patch, after
removal of "smatch" keyword, as it otherwise produces :
WARNING: A patch subject line should describe the change not the tool
that found it
when run through checkpatch.pl

So, if I understand correctly,

* prior 07edff926520, the scope of kbs (allocation/deallocation) was
external to switch-cases.
* post 07edff926520, kbs is allocated internally for each case,
however the deallocation remains external.

Thanks for the much cleaner suggestion, will move kfree() into the two
cases blocks.

Got it, other functions (except vt_do_kdskled) initialize ret to 0.
Thanks again.

Thanks a ton Johan for your time in investigating the history.
This has made things, in the current scenario, crystal clear.


Have floated the v5 patch at :
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-serial/20211108134901.7449-1-ajaygargnsit@gmail.com/T/#u

Let's continue further discussion there.


Thanks and Regards,
Ajay
