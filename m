Thanks for the review! First kernel patch so all feedback is welcome :)

The code change is essentially just relaxing the return value for the ACPI log
lookup. I'm not quite sure what is missing from the commit message in that
regard? Is the second paragraph insufficient?

This should only relax the cases where an error which is not ENODEV is returned.
Legacy hardware that return ENODEV because the table doesn't exist, or is
missing the log start and length, should be unaffected by this change.
