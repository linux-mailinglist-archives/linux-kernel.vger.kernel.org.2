Ok, so this is not a chip feature but more a host constraint.

In this case it would be a good idea to add a host DT property which
describes the zone to avoid accessing it. Something like:

	secure-area/secure-section = <start length>;

From the core perspective, we should parse this property early enough
and return -EIO when trying to access this area.

Does this solution sound reasonable to you?

Thanks,
