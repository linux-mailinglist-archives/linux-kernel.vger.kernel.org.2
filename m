Please see : https://lkml.kernel.org/r/9417218b-6eda-373b-a2cb-869089ffc7cd@arm.com
for my response in the previous version to this and the one with out-ports.

So, just to confirm again :
The CoreSight graph bindings expect the input ports and output ports
grouped under in-ports{} and out-ports{} respectively to avoid having
to specify the direction of the ports in the individual "port" nodes.
i.e

in-ports {

	property: ports
	  OR
	property: port

	required:
		OneOf:
			ports
			port
}

out-ports {

	# same as above
}

So thats why I added out-ports as a new object, where the ports/port
could be a child node.

Ideally the definition of out-ports /in-ports should go to a common schema
for CoreSight bindings, when we move to Yaml for the existing bindings,
which will follow in a separate series, later.
