So a very common coding pattern is to check a value w/o the lock, and
if it looks like we might need to check *with* a lock, we'll grab the
lock and recheck.  Does KCSAN understand that this sort of thing is
safe automatically?

In thie particular case, it's a bit more complicated than that; we're
checking a value, and then allocating memory, grabbing the spin lock,
and then re-checking the value, so we don't have to drop the spinlock,
allocate the memory, grab the lock again, and then rechecking the
value.  So even if KCSAN catches the simpler case as described above,
we still might need to explicitly mark the data_race explicitly.

But the more we could have the compiler automatically figure out
things without needing an explicit tag, it would seem to me that this
would be better, since manual tagging is going to be more error-prone.
