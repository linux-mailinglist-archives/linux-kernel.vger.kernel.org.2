I would rather think of your email as background material or trigger :)

We have had a discussion after the email thread and thought it is better
approach to stick to mdt format as used downstream and not have
confusion and issues resulting from upstream vs downstream

Since SM8350 is a new platform, so switching here onwards made sense,
hence this patch

I should have added more details for this in changelog as well...
