Saving it the loc_track doesn't preclude using the pointer that's being
passed around. It however avoids the extra kmalloc and turns out it
should also solve the return NULL from op->next() issue you describe below?

From these two probably the "free in op->next". But still inclined to
store it in loc_track.
Why does the API need to be so awkward...
