Can't we use the fancy features of public inbox to get the best of both
worlds?  Have the bug list (or even a collection of lists) but make the
linux-regressions one a virtual list keying off an imap flag which a
group of people control.  That way anything that is flagged as a
regression appears in that public inbox.  I assume the search can be
quite wide so we could flag a regression on any list indexed by lore?
