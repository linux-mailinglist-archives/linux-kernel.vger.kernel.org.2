Yeah, basically - but luckily the actual impact this has is limited by
the transitions that SELinux permits. If domain1 has no way to
transition to domain2, then it can't abuse this bug to pretend to be
domain2. I do have a reproducer that lets Android's "shell" domain
send a binder transaction that appears to come from "runas", but
luckily "runas" has no interesting privileges with regards to binder,
so that's not exploitable.

> How does passing the creds from the wrong tasks "fix" the problem?

This patch is not passing the creds from the "wrong" tasks at all. It
relies on the basic idea that when a security context opens a
resource, and then hands that resource to another context for
read/write operations, then you can effectively treat this as a
delegation of privileges from the original opener, and perform access
checks against the credentials using which the resource was opened.

In particular, we already have those semantics in the core kernel for
->read() and ->write() VFS operations - they are *not allowed* to look
at the credentials of the caller, and if they want to make security
checks, they have to instead check against file->f_cred, which are the
credentials using which the file was originally opened. (Yes, some
places still get that wrong.) Passing a file descriptor to another
task is a delegation of access, and the other task can then call
syscalls like read() / write() / mmap() on the file descriptor without
needing to have any access to the underlying file.

You can't really attribute binder transactions to specific tasks that
are actually involved in the specific transaction, neither on the
sending side nor on the receiving side, because binder is built around
passing data through memory mappings. Memory mappings can be accessed
by multiple tasks, and even a task that does not currently have it
mapped could e.g. map it at a later time. And on top of that you have
the problem that the receiving task might also go through privileged
execve() transitions.

But it is data that AFAICS needs to be preserved in the same places
where the creds need to be preserved, and it is also related to
security labels, so isn't "struct cred" a logical place to stuff it
anyway?
