Also:

* Some interrupts have no corresponding exception (system call and=20
system call vectored). This is not just semantics or a bug in the ISA
because it is different from other synchronous interrupts: instructions=20
which cause exceptions (e.g., a page fault) do not complete before=20
taking the interrupt whereas sc does.

* It's quite usual for an exception to not cause an interrupt=20
immediately (MSR[EE]=3D0, HMEER) or never cause one and be cleared by=20
other means (msgclr, mtDEC, mtHMER, etc).

* It's possible for an exception to cause different interrupts!
A decrementer exception usually causes a decrementer interrupt, but it
can cause a system reset interrupt if the processor was in a power
saving mode. A data storage exception can cause a DSI or HDSI interrupt
depending on LPCR settings, and many other examples.

So I agree with Segher on this. We should use interrupt for interrupts,=20
reduce exception except where we really mean it, and move away from vec=20
and trap (I've got this wrong in the past too I admit). We don't have to=20
do it all immediately, but new code should go in this direction.

Thanks,
Nick
