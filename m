==================== Changes in man-pages-5.11 ====================

Released: 2021-03-21, Munich


New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

close_range.2
    Stephen Kitt, Michael Kerrisk  [Christian Brauner]
        New page documenting close_range(2)

process_madvise.2
    Suren Baghdasaryan, Minchan Kim  [Michal Hocko, Alejandro Colomar,
    Michael Kerrisk]
        Document process_madvise(2)

fileno.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Split fileno(3) content out of ferror(3) into new page
            fileno(3) differs from the other functions in various ways.
            For example, it is governed by different standards,
            and can set 'errno'. Conversely, the other functions
            are about examining the status of a stream, while
            fileno(3) simply obtains the underlying file descriptor.
            Furthermore, splitting this function out allows
            for some cleaner upcoming changes in ferror(3).


Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

epoll_wait.2
    Willem de Bruijn  [Dmitry V. Levin]
        Add documentation of epoll_pwait2()
            Expand the epoll_wait() page with epoll_pwait2(), an epoll_wait()
            variant that takes a struct timespec to enable nanosecond
            resolution timeout.

fanotify_init.2
fanotify.7
    Jan Kara  [Steve Grubb]
        Document FAN_AUDIT flag and FAN_ENABLE_AUDIT

madvise.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add descriptions of MADV_COLD and MADV_PAGEOUT
            Taken from process_madvise(2).

openat2.2
    Jens Axboe
        Add RESOLVE_CACHED

prctl.2
    Gabriel Krisman Bertazi
        Document Syscall User Dispatch

mallinfo.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document mallinfo2() and note that mallinfo() is deprecated
            Document the mallinfo2() function added in glibc 2.33.
        Update example program to use mallinfo2()

system_data_types.7
    Alejandro Colomar
        Add off64_t to system_data_types(7)

ld.so.8
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document the --argv0 option added in glibc 2.33


Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    Alejandro Colomar
        SYNOPSIS: Use 'restrict' in prototypes
            This change has been completed for *all* relevant pages
            (around 135 pages in total).

Various pages
    Alejandro Colomar  [Zack Weinberg]
        Remove unused <sys/types.h>
            The manual pages are already inconsistent in which headers need
            to be included.  Right now, not all of the types used by a
            function have their required header included in the SYNOPSIS.

            If we were to add the headers required by all of the types used by
            functions, the SYNOPSIS would grow too much.  Not only it would
            grow too much, but the information there would be less precise.

            Having system_data_types(7) document each type with all the
            information about required includes is much more precise, and the
            info is centralized so that it's much easier to maintain.

            So let's document only the include required for the function
            prototype, and also the ones required for the macros needed to
            call the function.

            <sys/types.h> only defines types, not functions or constants, so
            it doesn't belong to man[23] (function) pages at all.

            I ignore if some old systems had headers that required you to
            include <sys/types.h> *before* them (incomplete headers), but if
            so, those implementations would be broken, and those headers
            should probably provide some kind of warning.  I hope this is not
            the case.

            [mtk: Already in 2001, POSIX.1 removed the requirement to
            include <sys/types.h> for many APIs, so this patch seems
            well past due.]

_exit.2
abort.3
err.3
exit.3
pthread_exit.3
setjmp.3
    Alejandro Colomar
        SYNOPSIS: Use 'noreturn' in prototypes
            Use standard C11 'noreturn' in these manual page for
            functions that do not return.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

getcpu.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Alejandro Colomar]
        Rewrite page to describe glibc wrapper function
            Since glibc 2.29, there is a wrapper for getcpu(2).
            The wrapper has only 2 arguments, omitting the unused
            third system call argument. Rework the manual page
            to reflect this.

kcmp.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since Linux 5.12, kcmp() availability is unconditional
            kcmp() is no longer dependent on CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE.

mmap2.2
    Alejandro Colomar
        Fix prototype parameter types
            There are many slightly different prototypes for this syscall,
            but none of them is like the documented one.
            Of all the different prototypes,
            let's document the asm-generic one.

mount.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that the 'data' argument can be NULL

syscall.2
    Peter H. Froehlich
        Update superh syscall convention

syscalls.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add epoll_pwait2()

netdevice.7
    Pali Roh√°r  [Alejandro Colomar]
        Update documentation for SIOCGIFADDR SIOCSIFADDR SIOCDIFADDR

netlink.7
    Pali Roh√°r  [Alejandro Colomar]
        Fix minimal Linux version for NETLINK_CAP_ACK
            NETLINK_CAP_ACK option was introduced in commit 0a6a3a23ea6e which first
            appeared in Linux version 4.3 and not 4.2.
    Pali Roh√°r  [Alejandro Colomar]
        Remove IPv4 from description
            rtnetlink is not only used for IPv4
    Philipp Schuster
        Clarify details of netlink error responses
            Make it clear that netlink error responses (i.e., messages with
            type NLMSG_ERROR (0x2)), can be longer than sizeof(struct
            nlmsgerr). In certain circumstances, the payload can be longer.
sock_diag.7
    Pali Roh√°r  [Alejandro Colomar]
        Fix recvmsg() usage in the example

tcp.7
    Enke Chen
        Documentation revision for TCP_USER_TIMEOUT
