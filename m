Ok, that wasn't really clear to me.

I still wouldn't say the group for mdevs is a fiction though.. rather
that the group device used for (no internal IOMMU case) mdevs is just
plain wrong.

No, they are likely to have changed permissions on the group device
node as part of the process, though.

*thinks*... yeah, ok, that was much too strong an assertion.  What I
was thinking of is the fact that this means that guarantees you'd
normally expect the kernel to enforce can be obviated by bad
configuration: chown-ing a device to root doesn't actually protect it
if there's another device in the same group exposed to other users.

But I guess you could say the same about, say, an unauthenticated nbd
export of a root-owned block device, so I guess that's not something
the kernel can reasonably enforce.


Ok.. you might be finally convincing me, somewhat.
