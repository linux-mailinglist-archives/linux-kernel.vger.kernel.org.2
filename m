I don't see why there's a problem?  You're saying "there might still be
vmalloc() callers which don't correctly handle allocation failures",
yes?

I'm suggesting that we use fault injection to cause a small proportion
of vmalloc() calls to artificially fail, so such buggy callers will
eventually be found and fixed.  Why does such a scheme require that
*all* vmalloc() calls fail?
