Hmm, this inconsistency looks not good to me.

"GNAME/ENAME" "SYSTEM.EVENT"
 - GNAME is "group name" but SYSTEM is "system name" but both must point
   same idea.
 - Delimiter character is different.

Aren't these confusing users?

One idea is adding a patch for kprobe and uprobe events to accept new
delimiter '.'. This will give a consistency with hist triggers too.

Also, you can add a note about that the system and group is same
meaning in events.

If this is not mandatory, you should write it as 

e:[GNAME/]ENAME SYSTEM.EVENT [FETCHARGS]

I'm not sure what the "no synthetic events can be attached to an event probe"
means.
Can you show an example command what this means?

OK, thanks for moving onto the dynevent. Let me check the code in another
mail.
Anyway, I think this is good starting point. 

Thank you,
