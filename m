With both of

    blk-mq: don't grab ->q_usage_counter in blk_mq_sched_bio_merge
    blk-mq: rename blk_attempt_bio_merge

applied, and the version above, I no longer saw the error, but the
boot sometimes hangs after:

    ext3 filesystem being remounted at / supports timestamps until
2038 (0x7fffffff)

I don't know how easy that is to trigger: it hung on my first try, but
the second and third tries it booted fully into old Debian userspace.

Worked fine in five subsequent boots. Thanks!
