I'm not sure I see the point; either it's needed or its not. I wonder if
there's a plan to fix this in future CPUs (another question for the Arm
folks).

If the mitigation is required, I'm not sure I see a lot of point in only
doing a half-baked job of it. It feels a bit like a box-ticking exercise,
in which case any overhead is too much.
