I don't think this properly answers the question I had on the previous version
of this patch, which was not just how we know that blk_ksm_register() will
succeed later, but also how we know that the blk_ksm_is_superset() check done
above is valid when some of the crypto capabilities may be cleared by
blk_ksm_register() later.  Is the assumption actually that in the device-mapper
case, blk_ksm_register() will never clear any crypto capabilities at all?
If so, can that be explained properly?
