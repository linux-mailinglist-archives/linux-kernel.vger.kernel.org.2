No need to test for this, right?

How can this happen?

Why did you move this call to way down here?  It's fine in the first
line of the function above as-is.

You are incrementing the bus, which is nice, but I do not understand why
it is needed.  What is causing the bus to go away _before_ the devices
are going away?  Busses almost never are removed from the system, and if
they are, all devices associated with them are removed first.  So I do
not think you need to increment anything with that here.

But step back, what prevented the kobject from decrementing between the
call to dev_attr_show() and the first line of the function?

The kobject needs to be incremented before show is called, right?  Or
does kernfs handle this properly already?  I don't have the time at the
moment to dig into this, but maybe this isn't an issue?  Look at how
sysfs handles the kobject lookups for kernfs nodes to see if all is sane
there, maybe there isn't an issue?

thanks,
