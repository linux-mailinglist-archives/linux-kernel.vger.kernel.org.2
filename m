I really dislike this. We shouldn't have a sementically different
behavior for a debugging kernel.

Is there any technical reason to not do fatal_signal_pending bailout
unconditionally? OOM victim based check will make it less likely and
therefore any potential bugs are just hidden more. So I think we should
really go with fatal_signal_pending check here.

This allocator interface is used in some real hot paths. It is also
meant to be fail fast interface (e.g. it only allocates from pcp
allocator) so it shouldn't bring any additional risk to memory depletion
under heavy memory pressure.

In other words I do not see any reason to bail out in this code path.
