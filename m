I didn't say it was easy. I meant that we support it and we can consider
its support as well.

I went back to the drawing board with this in mind. But a few things to
note:

The issue of the deadlock does not imply a lock has to be global. So long
as the rmmod path uses a lock which is also used by sysfs files, you can end
up in a deadlock.

Despite this, I tried to remove the global lock on the zram driver, however it
just doesn't seem right to remove it, its being used to help protect a
generic state machine and a global lock seems perfectly reasonable for the
driver.

If you still believe the global is not needed, let me know what you come
up with as an alternative. I just can't find a clean way to do away with
that, *and*, I still also think this pattern might be prevalent in the
kernel in different places. I am not sure we can set as generic rule:

  "Thou Shalt Not use the same lock on rmmod and sysfs files"

I'm moving forward in my v3 series by keeping it and instead now
providing module device attribute wrappers. The idea with this is,
that if we are not yet sure what to do yet, we can at least have
drivers integrate these helpers as well when and if they find they need
a similar solution.
