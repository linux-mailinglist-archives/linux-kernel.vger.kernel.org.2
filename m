I do assume that higher tier memory offers better performance (or less
access latency) than a lower tier memory.  Otherwise, this defeats the
whole purpose of promoting hot memory from lower tier to a higher tier,
and demoting cold memory to a lower tier.

Tiers assumption is embedded once we define this promotion/demotion relationship
between the numa nodes.

So if 

  node_m ----demotes----> node_n
         <---promotes---- 

then node_m is one tier higher tier than node_n. This promotion/demotion
relationship between the nodes is the underpinning of Dave and Ying's
demotion and promotion patch sets.

I think if you configure a promotion/demotion relationship between
DRAM over CXL and local-socket connected DRAM, you could divide them
up into separate tiers.  Or you don't care about the difference and
you will configure them not to have a promotion/demotion relationship
and they will be at the same tier.  Balance within the same tier
will be effected by the autonuma mechanism.

Tier definition is an admin's choice, of where the admin think the
hot memory should reside after looking at the memory performance.
It falls out of how the admin construct the promotion/demotion relationship
between the nodes and OS does not assume the tier relationship from
memory performance directly.

I am still trying to understand how a numa centric control actually
work. Putting limits on every numa node for each cgroup
seems to make the system configuration quite complicated.  Looking
forward to your proposal so I can better understand that perspective.
