That's not entirely true. In genpd_add_subdomain() we verify that if
the child is powered on, the parent must already be powered on,
otherwise we treat this a bad setup and return an error code.

What seems to be missing though, is that if there is a performance
state applied for the child domain, that should be propagated to the
parent domain too. Right?

I guess that minimum performance state could be considered as a
"required-opp" in the DT node for the power-domain provider, no?

Another option would simply be to manage this solely in the
platform/soc specific genpd provider. Would that work?
