I performed some tests and here is a small example that can be reproduced
even with qemu.
With O_NDELAY fix:
$ fdlist # no floppy inserted
fdlist (): drive fd0 does not exist

Without O_NDELAY fix:
$ fdlist # no floppy inserted
NAME   TYPE  STATUS
 fd0  2880K  not mounted

That's because of O_RDONLY|O_NDELAY open in probe_drive:
https://sources.debian.org/src/fdutils/5.6-2/src/fdmount.c/#L390

I guess that's why the original patch was reverted
f2791e7eadf4 Revert "floppy: refactor open() flags handling"
We still have software that depends on O_NDELAY in floppies
and this patch will be reverted again.

Meanwhile I can't fully reproduce the issues with libblkid.
I know that systemd-udevd tries to open /dev/fd0 during boot
with O_RDONLY|O_NDELAY. With O_NDELAY implemented we don't call
floppy_revalidate() which result in an attempt to read block 0
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.10.20/source/drivers/block/floppy.c#L4127
However, *with* O_NDELAY fix we try to read block 0 and get kernel
log errors if no floppy inserted:
[    1.732360] blk_update_request: I/O error, dev fd0, sector 0 op 0x0:(READ) flags 0x0 phys_seg 1 prio class 0
[    1.732822] floppy: error 10 while reading block 0
If floppy inserted this results in a boot delay on a
real system.

Jiri, Kurt, can you give more details about test conditions
for O_NDELAY problem or maybe even provide some examples?

Maybe it will cheaper to implement a special probing for
floppies in new software than drop O_NDELAY for all already
written software. Of course, if there is no cheap and obvious
in-kernel fix.
