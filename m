Indeed. And I find it odd to say "it's not a problem, we don't have
any HW available". By this token, why should we merge this work the
first place, or any of the MTE work that has gone into the kernel over
the past years?

That's a reasonable approach. I wonder whether we could do that right
at the point where the memslot is associated with the VM, like this:

diff --git a/arch/arm64/kvm/mmu.c b/arch/arm64/kvm/mmu.c
index a36a2e3082d8..ebd3b3224386 100644
--- a/arch/arm64/kvm/mmu.c
+++ b/arch/arm64/kvm/mmu.c
@@ -1376,6 +1376,9 @@ int kvm_arch_prepare_memory_region(struct kvm *kvm,
 		if (!vma)
 			break;
 
+		if (kvm_has_mte(kvm) && vma->vm_flags & VM_SHARED)
+			return -EINVAL;
+
 		/*
 		 * Take the intersection of this VMA with the memory region
 		 */

which takes the problem out of the fault path altogether? We document
the restriction and move on. With that, we can use a non-locking
version of mte_sync_page_tags().

Works for me.

Thanks,
