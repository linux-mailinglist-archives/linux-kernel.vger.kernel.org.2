There are many different things, and I am not sure I follow you on all
counts.

If your customers are asking you for a 6 year LTS kernel, does not that
mean they themselves plan to commit to that time frame?

Assuming you are delivering a downstream kernel with all that is needed
to run on the hardware you support plus all the extra fancy stuff your
customers pay you for, what more do the customers do on top? Do they
happen to merge stable updates with your downstream tree, and why do
they do that, should not you be their upstream?

Well you really have the best of both worlds here, you are not forced to
update your downstream fork of the stable kernel every week, though
bonus points if you do.

For instance I try to test all the stable release candidates for 4.9,
5.4 and 5.10, and merge the stable tags every week when they show up. We
do release to our customers every 6 weeks though, so usually they will
jump several stable releases, and they are fine with that.

Yes it takes time, but I would rather do that than have to continuously
respond to questions about is this CVE fixed in kernel X.Y.Z like it
used to be before we did that. It also helps catch problem faster before
customers do, the usual benefits of continuous integration/delivery.
