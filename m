Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: clk: Convert rockchip,rk3399-cru to DT schema

Convert the rockchip,rk3399-cru binding to DT schema format.
Tested with
ARCH=arm64 make dt_binding_check DT_SCHEMA_FILES=Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/rockchip,rk3399-cru.yaml
ARCH=arm64 make dtbs_check DT_SCHEMA_FILES=Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/rockchip,rk3399-cru.yaml

One caveat is that this node expects certain external clocks, mainly 'xin24m'.
From what I read of clock-bindings.txt, it seems the way to make this dependency
explicit would be to add 'clocks' and 'clock-names' properties to both the DT
and the binding. But since I'm not sure changing the DT ABI is desirable, I just
moved that information to the binding description for now.

-* Rockchip RK3399 Clock and Reset Unit
-
-The RK3399 clock controller generates and supplies clock to various
-controllers within the SoC and also implements a reset controller for SoC
-peripherals.
-
-Required Properties:
-
-- compatible: PMU for CRU should be "rockchip,rk3399-pmucru"
-- compatible: CRU should be "rockchip,rk3399-cru"
-- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
-  region.
-- #clock-cells: should be 1.
-- #reset-cells: should be 1.
-
-Optional Properties:
-
-- rockchip,grf: phandle to the syscon managing the "general register files".
-  It is used for GRF muxes, if missing any muxes present in the GRF will not
-  be available.
-
-Each clock is assigned an identifier and client nodes can use this identifier
-to specify the clock which they consume. All available clocks are defined as
-preprocessor macros in the dt-bindings/clock/rk3399-cru.h headers and can be
-used in device tree sources. Similar macros exist for the reset sources in
-these files.
-
-External clocks:
-
-There are several clocks that are generated outside the SoC. It is expected
-that they are defined using standard clock bindings with following
-clock-output-names:
- - "xin24m" - crystal input - required,
- - "xin32k" - rtc clock - optional,
- - "clkin_gmac" - external GMAC clock - optional,
- - "clkin_i2s" - external I2S clock - optional,
- - "pclkin_cif" - external ISP clock - optional,
- - "clk_usbphy0_480m" - output clock of the pll in the usbphy0
- - "clk_usbphy1_480m" - output clock of the pll in the usbphy1
-
-Example: Clock controller node:
-
-	pmucru: pmu-clock-controller@ff750000 {
-		compatible = "rockchip,rk3399-pmucru";
-		reg = <0x0 0xff750000 0x0 0x1000>;
-		#clock-cells = <1>;
-		#reset-cells = <1>;
-	};
-
-	cru: clock-controller@ff760000 {
-		compatible = "rockchip,rk3399-cru";
-		reg = <0x0 0xff760000 0x0 0x1000>;
-		#clock-cells = <1>;
-		#reset-cells = <1>;
-	};
-
-Example: UART controller node that consumes the clock generated by the clock
-  controller:
-
-	uart0: serial@ff1a0000 {
-		compatible = "rockchip,rk3399-uart", "snps,dw-apb-uart";
-		reg = <0x0 0xff180000 0x0 0x100>;
-		clocks = <&cru SCLK_UART0>, <&cru PCLK_UART0>;
-		clock-names = "baudclk", "apb_pclk";
-		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 99 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
-		reg-shift = <2>;
-		reg-io-width = <4>;
-	};
