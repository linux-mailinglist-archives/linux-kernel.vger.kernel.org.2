I'm wondering what 'threat models' CFI is trying to protect from.
Adding code to code doing 'call indirect' can only protect against
calls to 'inappropriate' functions.
You may also be worried about whether functions are being called
from the right place - someone might manage to 'plant' an indirect
jump somewhere - probably more likely than overwriting an address.
But a truly malicious caller will be able to subvert most checks.
And non-malicious errors can be largely eliminated by strengthening
normal compiler type checking.

A simple run-time check would be adding an extra 'hidden' function
parameter that is a hash of the prototype.
Especially if the hash is based on a build-id - so differs
between kernel builds.

Having the caller scan a list of valid targets seems just broken.
You might as well replace the function pointer with an index
into the array of valid targets.
