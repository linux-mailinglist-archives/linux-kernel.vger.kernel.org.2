From what I remember the compiler adds code prior to every jump indirect
to check that the function address is in the list of valid functions
(with a suitable prototype - or some similar check).

So it add a run-time search to every indirect call.

What would be more sensible would be a hidden extra parameter that is
a hash of the prototype that is saved just before the entry point.
Then the caller and called function could both check.
That is still a moderate cost for an indirect call.

Anything that can write asm can get around any check - it just gets a
bit harder.
But overwritten function pointers would be detected - which I assume
is the main threat.
