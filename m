I have another concern. the design requires the low level driver poll
for a field of the input parameter that the framework manages. It is
unnormal, like an implicit cancel call to the driver.

How about the framework explicitly call cancel() when needed? Of cource
we need to declare the cancel() could be called when other callback is
in progress.
