No, that's not what is happening.

The irqchip driver starts, creates an irqdomain. File gets created, at
least in theory (it fails because debugfs isn't ready, but that's not
the issue).

It then changes an attribute to the domain (the so-called bus_token),
which gets reflected in the domain name to avoid aliasing.
Delete/create follows.

See above. We encode properties of the domain in the filename, and
reflect the change of these properties as they happen.
