One textbook C implementation is in perfbook CodeSamples/defer/hazptr.[hc]
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/paulmck/perfbook.git

A production-tested C++ implementation is in the folly library:

https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/master/folly/synchronization/Hazptr.h

However, the hazard-pointers get-a-reference operation requires a full
barrier.  There are ways to optimize this away in some special cases,
one of which is used in the folly-library hash-map code.

> Paul, I'm adding you for two reasons.  First, you seem to enjoy bizarre locking schemes.  Secondly, because maybe RCU could actually work here.  The basic idea is that we want to keep an mm_struct from being freed at an inopportune time.  The problem with naively using RCU is that each CPU can use one single mm_struct while in an idle extended quiescent state (but not a user extended quiescent state).  So rcu_read_lock() is right out.  If RCU could understand this concept, then maybe it could help us, but this seems a bit out of scope for RCU.

OK, I should look at your patch, but that will be after morning meetings.

On RCU and idle, much of the idle code now allows rcu_read_lock() to be
directly, thanks to Peter's recent work.  Any sort of interrupt or NMI
from idle can also use rcu_read_lock(), including the IPIs that are now
done directly from idle.  RCU_NONIDLE() makes RCU pay attention to the
code supplied as its sole argument.

Or is your patch really having the CPU expect a mm_struct to stick around
across the full idle sojourn, and without the assistance of mmgrab()
and mmdrop()?

Anyway, off to meetings...  Hope this helps in the meantime.

							Thanx, Paul
