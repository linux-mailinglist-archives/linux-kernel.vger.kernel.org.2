Agreed. Now, we would then need a place to dump these as well. I guess
blktets would be it for the block layer... and fstests for fs. If done
with livepatching it would take a long time, consider the time added for
probing modules just for a new fault injection for a few routines...
how many modules.. and time.

ebpf maybe. Someone is going to have to try it.

Another possibility is kunit, and I think the tests would be faster.
However maintained boiler place would still be needed.

Indeed. What would be better is to have the ability to get this for
free and programatically enable knobs. Now fault-injection has some
ability to fail on functions dynamically but I haven't tested that.
Reason I didn't go with that is we want certain functions to fail but
*only* in certain context, not all the time for every caller. This
approach was safer and specific to the block layer, and in fact
only applicable to the add_disk() path.

Or we just get cranking and produce proof of concepts to compare and
contrast later. At least I hope this patch and the respective blktests
patches suffice to help demo what we need to test.
