The problem is that GFP_DMA doesn't always mean the same thing.
Overall, we need to hear from Rockchip about the exact nature of the
problem, and then we *may* be able to work something out.

I'd also like to understand whether it is broken because you happen to
have pre-release silicon that will never make it into the wild, or if
this is the real thing that is going to ship on millions of devices.

Thanks,
