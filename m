Yes, in the end, the whole system was affected, as follows

Great. If you have any progress, we'll be happy to test it in our 
production environment. We are also looking forward to working together 
to optimize it.

Yes, but unfortunately, it may not be finished in a short time.

We may refer to the documentation of the qemo community as follows:

https://wiki.qemu.org/ToDo/Block

Add a cancel command to the virtio-blk device so that running requests 
can be aborted. This requires changing the VIRTIO spec, extending QEMU's 
device emulation, and implementing blk_mq_ops->timeout() in Linux 
virtio_blk.ko. This task depends on first implementing real request 
cancellation in QEMU.
