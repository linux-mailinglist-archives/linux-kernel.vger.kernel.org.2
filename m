That would be lovely but is unlikely to ever happen. Numerous people 
have tried over the years - many, including me, would love for ZFS to be 
mainlined but unless Oracle decides to re-license the original code this 
will most likely not happen [3].

This is not really the main issue I was trying to highlight though.
What I was highlighting is the fact that exported symbols change license 
depending on the kconfig!
This will randomly stop dkms modules from building depending on my (or 
my distributions) kconfig. To me as a user this effectively BREAKS user 
space.
And yes, I am aware exported symbols are not syscalls but I thought 
there was at least some type of stability guarantee within the same 
kernel version. Maybe my thoughts on that matter are incorrect though.
