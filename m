Hi, we have written a user case to trigger this race mentioned above. 
this case just create one reader

to open DSO in RDONLY mode, and keep making the mapping page of DSO use 
huge pages by madvise,

then multiple writer to open and write the same DSO.

I will send it later after simple adjust.

Thanks
