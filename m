Let me just clarify one thing. I haven't been proposing per NUMA limits.
As I've said above it would be quite tricky to use and the behavior
would be tricky as well. All I am saying is that we do not want to have
an interface that is tightly bound to any specific HW setup (fast RAM as
a top tier and PMEM as a fallback) that you have proposed here. We want
to have a generic NUMA based abstraction. How that abstraction is going
to look like is an open question and it really depends on usecase that
we expect to see.
