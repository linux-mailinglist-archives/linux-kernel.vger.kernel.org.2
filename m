Subject: [PATCH 10/23] tty: reformat TTY_DRIVER_ flags into kernel-doc
Date:   Fri, 26 Nov 2021 09:15:58 +0100

X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

We want to reference TTY_DRIVER_* flags in Documentation/ later in this
series. But the current documentation in the TTY_DRIVER_*'s header does
not allow that. Reformat it to kernel-doc using "DOC" directive and
line-feeds, so that we can include it as it is.
