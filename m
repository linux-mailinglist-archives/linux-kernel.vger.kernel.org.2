Well if we go that way, there might be additional benefits:

depending of gfp flags, kmalloc() would allocate from:

kmalloc-* caches that never have kmemcg objects, thus can be used for the objcg
pointer arrays
kmalloc-cg-* caches that have only kmemcg unreclaimable objects
kmalloc-rcl-* and dma-kmalloc-* can stay with on-demand
memcg_alloc_page_obj_cgroups()

This way we fully solve the issues that this patchset solves. In addition we get
better separation between kmemcg and !kmemcg thus save memory - no allocation of
the array as soon as a single object appears in slab. For "kmalloc-8" we now
have 8 bytes for the useful data and 8 bytes for the obj_cgroup  pointer.
