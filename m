Excuse me, not exactly. Mount was one example scenario to showcase why
allowing attaching without any validation could be dangerous.
Basically, we want a way to check and verify if the backend specified
at map time and backend specified at attach(reconfigure) time are
matching for a given device, only if they are matching proceed to
attach else fail.

IMHO, we should almost never allow reconfigure/reattaching a given
device with a different backend (except in cases like live migration,
which the application should take care of), and not just when nbd disk
is opened exclusively.

When an attach (reconfigure) is issued, Its application's logic to
provide the same matching cookie (or device-string or a uuid) so that
kernel can validate it with /sys/block/nbdX/backend and continue
safely to attach and reassign the device back.

This is how it is supposed to be used:
