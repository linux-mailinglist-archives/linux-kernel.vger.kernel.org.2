The PMIC TEMP_ALARM peripheral maintains an internal over-temperature 
stage: 0, 1, 2, or 3.  Stage 0 is normal operation below the lowest 
(stage 1) threshold [usually 95 C].  When in stage 1, the temperature is 
between the stage 1 and 2 thresholds [stage 2 threshold is usually 115 
C].  Upon hitting the stage 3 threshold [usually 145 C], the PMIC 
hardware will automatically shut down the system.

The TEMP_ALARM IRQ fires on stage 0 -> 1 and 1 -> 0 transitions.  We 
therefore set polling-delay = <0> since there is no need for software to 
monitor the temperature periodically when operating in stage 0.  Upon 
crossing the stage 1 threshold, SW receives the IRQ and the thermal 
framework hits its first trip changing the thermal zone to passive mode. 
  This then engages the 100 ms polling enabled via polling-delay-passive 
= <100>.  If the temperate keeps climbing and passes the stage 2 
threshold, the thermal framework hits the second trip (which is 
critical) and it initiates an orderly shutdown.  If the temperature 
drops below the stage 1 threshold, then the thermal framework exits 
passive mode and stops polling.  This approach reduces/eliminates the 
software overhead when not at an elevated temperature.
