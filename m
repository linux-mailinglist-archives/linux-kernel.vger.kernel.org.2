Currently sys_cacheflush() doesn't do this, and IIUC it has never done
remote context synchronization even for architectures that need that
(e.g. x86 requiring a serializing instruction).

My intuition is the other way around, and that this is a gnereally
useful thing for architectures that require context synchronization.

It's not clear to me what "the right thing" would mean specifically, and
on architectures with userspace cache maintenance JITs can usually do
the most optimal maintenance, and only need help for the context
synchronization.

Thanks,
