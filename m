The driver already seems to support lowering the link rate during link
training. Can't we try to train at the highest rate and then downgrade
the link speed until it trains properly? I sort of fail to see why we
need to introduce a bunch of complexity around limiting the link rate on
certain boards if the driver can figure out that link training doesn't
work at HBR3 so it should try to train at HBR2 instead.
