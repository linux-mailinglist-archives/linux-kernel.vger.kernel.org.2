Sure. But what if there appear more users where it will matter. Those would get
better performance out of kmalloc_slab().

OK.

Yes.

Right.

They are already "duplicated". But one is tailored for constant sizes, the other
for variable sizes.

So should be kmalloc_index(). However it needs to have the full implementation
in a header accessible to all kmalloc() users to work, so it's there, visible to
anyone.

That's true.

OK then.

I can accept that, but please also modify/expand the newly added comment. Now
it's *normally* evaluated in compile-time. And there should be warning that
anyone calling it with size_is_constant == false should do that only in context
where performance (and code bloat, most likely too) doesn't matter, such as unit
test.

Thanks, Vlastimil
