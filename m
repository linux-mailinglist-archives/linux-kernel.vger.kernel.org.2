Why 640 bits?

In both cases there are 256 bits for the entropy input and 128 bits for
the nonce. If Jitter RNG is not available, then urandom is used instead,
which means that the system is not FIPS compliant.

This follows the SP800-90Ar1, section 8.6.7: [a nonce shall be] "A value
with at least (security_strength/2) bits of entropy".

We can increase the amount of data pulled from get_random_bytes (how to
decide the amount?), but as we understand the document, this should be
part of the personalization string and additional input, not the nonce.
I guess it may not change much according to the implementation, as for
the order of random and entropy concatenation, but these changes align
with the specifications and it should help FIPS certifications.
