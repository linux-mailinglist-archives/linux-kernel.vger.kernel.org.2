Yes, it sounds like there's enough uncertainty for now that this needs 
to be an opt-in feature. However, I still think that non-strict mode 
could use it generically, since that's all about over-invalidating to 
save time on individual unmaps - and relatively non-deterministic - already.

So maybe we have a second set of iommu_flush_ops, or just a flag 
somewhere to control the tlb_flush_walk functions internally, and the 
choice can be made in the iommu_get_dma_strict() test, but also forced 
on all the time by your init_context hook. What do you reckon?

Robin.
