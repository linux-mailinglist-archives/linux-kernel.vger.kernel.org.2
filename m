I think it's hard to predict which sub-streams you are going to need
before you have a bug to debug. Hence I would err on the side of
enabling too much. This also means that better or more refined
categorisation might not be that much of help - or if it is, then are
the excluded debug messages worth having in the kernel to begin with.
Well, we're probably not that interested in GPU debugs but just
everything related to the KMS side, which on the existing categories
is... everything except half of CORE and DRIVER, maybe? Not sure.

Maybe Sean has a better idea.

My feeling is that that could mean in the order of hundreds of log
events at framerate (e.g. 60 times per second) per each enabled output
individually. And per DRM device, of course. This is with the
uninteresting GPU debugs already excluded.

Still, I don't think the flight recorder buffer would need to be
massive. I suspect it would be enough to hold a few frames' worth which
is just a split second under active operation. When something happens,
the userspace stack is likely going to stop on its tracks immediately
to collect the debug information, which means the flooding should pause
and the relevant messages don't get overwritten before we get them. In
a multi-seat system where each device is controlled by a separate
display server instance, per-device logs would help with this. OTOH,
multi-seat is not a very common use case I suppose.
