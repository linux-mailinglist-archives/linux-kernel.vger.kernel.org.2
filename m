It is not that easy, unfortunately. On some cases (specially due to
DT binding renames) some patches change the context of a hunk, affecting
a subsequent patch.

I tried a couple of times in the past to send the patches individually,
but that was messier, as there was harder for people to apply them,
as, instead of running b4 just once to get everything, maintainers
would need to apply each patch individually. Also, there were cases
where the patch order would be relevant, due to context changes.

-

Btw, talking about what it would be easier, the best procedure to
adopt is to run:

	./scripts/documentation-file-ref-check 

Before sending/applying patches touching documents.

That would avoid the need of such fixup patches ;-)

Unfortunately, in the specific case of dt-bindings, things are not
that easy, as doc changes usually go via one tree, while references 
to them come from other places.

Regards,
Mauro
