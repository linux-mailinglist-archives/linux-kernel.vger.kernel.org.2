Sure, but I think Doug was referring to powering up the device connected
to the SN65DSI86 output. When that device (from a DT and DRM bridge
point of view) is an external connector, it means that the hardware
device is an external HDMI/DP sink, and we have no way to control its
power. The SN65DSI86 itself of course needs to be powered.

Not if the panel exposes modes through EDID, in that case it's the
responsibility of the device connected to the DDC/AUX port to read the
EDID and provide modes. The panel driver won't be able to handle it on
its own.

If the SN65DSI86 has to call drm_panel_get_modes(), which will then call
back into the SN65DSI86 driver to perform the EDID read, it seems to me
that the panel driver shouldn't be involved at all.

DRM bridges have "recently" gained new operations to retrieve EDID, and
there's a helper (drm_bridge_connector) that creates a connector for a
chain of bridges, delegating connector operations to the appropriate
bridge in the chain. This seems a better way forward to me (but I'm
biased, as I've authored that code :-)).
