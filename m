I think there is a small confusion. The plugin nor the data it generates 
is not to be used by a kernel unwinder. It's here to allow objtool to 
assess whether the code being checked can be unwound (?) reliably (not 
omitting functions). Part of this is checking that a branch/jump in a 
function does not end up in some code that is not related to the 
function without setting up a call frame.

This is about static validation rather than functionality.

I'll give it a try at least for the arm64 side.
