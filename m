Ah, yes, sorry.  We do need an API that lets the kernel make more of
the decisions too.  For userspace drivers it would generally be
sufficient to just ask for XXX size of IOVA space wherever you can get
it.  Handling guests requires more precision.  So, maybe a request
interface with a bunch of hint variables and a matching set of
MAP_FIXED-like flags to assert which ones aren't negotiable.

*Every* vIOMMU driver needs more exact control.  The guest drivers
will expect to program the guest devices with IOVAs matching the guest
platform's IOMMU model.  Therefore the backing host IOMMU has to be
programmed to respond to those IOVAs.  If it can't be, there's no way
around it, and you want to fail out early.  With this model that will
happen when qemu (say) requests the host IOMMU window(s) to match the
guest's expected IOVA ranges.

Actually, come to that even guests without a vIOMMU need more exact
control: they'll expect IOVA to match GPA, so if your host IOMMU can't
be set up translate the full range of GPAs, again, you're out of luck.

The only reason x86 has been able to ignore this is that the
assumption has been that all IOMMUs can translate IOVAs from 0..<a big
enough number for any reasonable RAM size>.  Once you really start to
look at what the limits are, you need the exact window control I'm
describing.

So for TCEs (and maybe other IOMMUs out there), the IO page tables are
independent of the CPU page tables.  They don't have the same format,
and they don't necessarily have the same page size.  In the case of a
bare metal kernel working in physical addresses they can use that TCE
page size however they like.  For userspace you get another layer of
complexity.  Essentially to implement things correctly the backing
IOMMU needs to have a page size granularity that's the minimum of
whatever granularity the userspace or guest driver expects and the
host page size backing the memory.

Windows really aren't ppc specific.  They're absolutely there on x86
and everything else as well - it's just that people are used to having
a window at 0..<something largish> that you can often get away with
treating it sloppily.
