We would perhaps still need the 'assigned-opp-level' or equivalent since
the default requirement of devices is not always the least level supported,
in some cases it might be slightly higher corner which would then need to
be set explicitly.

I was hoping on getting some more testing done with that patch especially for
any regression on the sc7180 and sc7280 devices, which I haven't got to yet.
Are you getting these patches ready for merge for the -rc cycle or for the
next merge window?
