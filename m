Is it possible to do the filtering of the module symbols somewhere else like
in kernel/kallsyms.c? I'm not that familiar with it but it seems like
at one point when populating kallsyms '$...' functions are filtered out, but
when modules are loaded the symbols are not filtered because another code path is
used?

If kallsyms has some duplicate addresses in there then isn't the bug in kallsyms
rather than perf? And another tool could get confused too.
