Good Day My Dear,

I am contacting you through this means because I need your urgent
assistance and also help me to carry a charity project in your
country. I found your email address as a true child of God for past
few days now that I have been praying to know if you are really the
chosen one for this great charity project, according to God's
direction, after all prayers I am convinced, and I have decided to
contact you. Please, i want you use the funds for the Lord's work,
with confidence, read and respond now.


My name is  Mrs. Nadia Emman, a widow, but currently based in West
Africa since my life with my late husband, who was a businessman in
this country before dying some years ago. We were married to many
years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted only
six days and I myself have been suffering from an ovarian cancer
disease. At this moment I am about to finish the race in this way
because the disease has reached a very bad stage, without any family
member and without children. I hope you do not expose or betray this
trust and I am sure that I am about to trust you for the mutual
benefit of orphans and the less privileged. I have some funds that I
inherited from my late husband, the total sum of ($ 12,500,000.00)
deposited at a bank here in Burkina Faso. After knowing my current
state of health, I decided to trust you with this fund, believing that
you will use it in the way I will instruct here.


you will use this $12.5 Million for public benefit as follows;

1. Establish An Orphanage Home To Help The Orphanages Children.
2. Build A Hospital To Help The Poor.
3. Build A Nursing Home For Elderly People Need Care & Meal.

You will named them after my late husband.Therefore, I need you to
help me and claim this money and use it for charities, for orphanages
and provide justice and help to the poor, needy and to promote the
words of God and the effort to maintain the house of God, according to
the bible in the book of. Jeremiah 22: 15-16, without minding our
different religions.

It will be a pleasure to compensate with 40% percent of the total
money for your effort in handling the transaction, while 60% of the
money will go to charity project.

All I need from you is sincerity and ability to complete the task of
God without any failure. It will be my pleasure to see that the bank
has finally released and transferred the fund to your bank account in
the country, even before I die here in the hospital, due to my current
state of health, everything must be processed as soon as possible.

I am waiting for your immediate response, if you are only interested
in obtaining more details about the transaction and execution of this
humanitarian project for the glory and honor of God.

Sorry if you received this letter in your spam, is due to recent
connection/network error here in the country.

Please I am waiting for your urgent reply now.

May God Bless you,
Mrs. Nadia Emman.
