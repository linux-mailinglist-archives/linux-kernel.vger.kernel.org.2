I agree that an immutable commit is not needed on this specific patch.
The updated revision[1] posted had already dropped that request.

On the other hand, series[2] makes Rob's checks fail (as it runs on
rc1) - and helps keep everyone sane by getting an immutable commit
merged in allowing for follow on patches to stay clean.

NOTE: I do test patches for both checks and functionality to the best I
can on both rc1 (my tree)[3] and on linux-next on the day I pick the
patches up.
