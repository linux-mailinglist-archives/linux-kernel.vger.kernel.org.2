Yes, I do agree.

I do not remember any reports about the existing WARN_ON but it is not
really hard to imagine a charging imbalance to be introduced easily.

The lack of external synchronization makes it more tricky because
certain charges might get just lost depending on the ordering. This
sucks but considering that the system is already botched and counters
cannot be trusted this is definitely better than a potentially
completely unusable memcg. It would be nice to mention that in the above
paragraph as a caveat.
