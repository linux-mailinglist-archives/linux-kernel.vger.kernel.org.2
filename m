What does this "(optional)" means? If you mean the property is optional
then it should be described accordingly in the yaml file, or am I
missing something?

I wonder if it wouldn't be better to make this a NAND chip node
property. I don't think a qcom prefix is needed as potentially many
other SoCs might have the same "feature".

I'm fine adding support for it in the qcom driver only though.
