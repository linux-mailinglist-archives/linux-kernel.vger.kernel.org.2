I would explicitly mention that this depends on pagefault_out_of_memory
to not trigger out_of_memory because then a memcg failure can unwind to
VM_FAULT_OOM and cause a global OOM killer.

Maybe it would be even better to fold the removal to this patch so the
dependency is more obvious. I will live that to you.

Fixes tag would be quite hard here. For example you certainly didn't
have a practically unbound vector to go over the hard limit - like
vmalloc. At least not after __GFP_ACCOUNT has been introduced. So I
would just not bother with a Fixes tag at all rather than cause it more
questions than answers.

Other than that looks good to me.
