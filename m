I have completed a comparison of the security manager and the FPGA manager
to see how the secure update functions can be integrated into the FPGA
manager. I'll send that out separately as an RFC document (it is about 150
lines).

FYI: In my conversations with Richard, we have learned that what we are
trying to accomplish is not as similar as it seemed. Richard is effectively
wanting to do a "dry-run" of an existing FPGA Manager function to verify
authentication of an image. Based on the results, higher-level code may
choose to write the image to flash.

The security manager is all about providing a common user API (sysfs
interface) for tranferring an image to an FPGA card while managing a
completion time (including authentication and FLASH) of up to 40 minutes.
