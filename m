It's good to extend an IP, but it needs a published SPEC and stable
register interfaces. For now, the spi-altera driver conforms to the
"SPI Core" chapter of the following spec:

https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/programmable/documentation/sfo1400787952932.html

There is no info about the core parameter register and this specific
indirect access bus. That's why I don't see these additional parts as
the enhancements to spi-altera. This DFL feature is like a wrapper for
the spi-altera sub device.
