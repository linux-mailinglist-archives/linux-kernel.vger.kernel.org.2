Well, I guess the problem is that proper lock ordering is transaction start
-> page lock and this patch inverts it so it creates all sorts of deadlock
possibilities. Lockdep will not catch this problem because page lock is not
tracked by it.

I do understand the problem description but this just isn't a viable
solution to it. There are some possible solutions like locking the first
page outside of transaction, then unlocking it, starting a transaction and
then only trylocking pages in mpage_prepare_extent_to_map() but it tends to
result in pretty ugly code. Also we'd need to make sure we don't call
submit_bio() when having transaction started (as that is where throttling
happens) - any such place may cause described latency problems. It's going
to be rather difficult to find and address all such places.
