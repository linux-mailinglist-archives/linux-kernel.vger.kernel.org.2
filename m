Thanks!

And now, looking more deeply, I feel more desperate.

This bug makes the expected padding gone on little-endian.
On LE 32bit, the buggy definition is:

	char __pad1[0];
	u32 appl_ptr;
	char __pad2[0]; // this should have been [4]
	char __pad3[0];
	u32 avail_min;
	char __pad4[4];
	
When an application issues SYNC_PTR64 ioctl to submit appl_ptr and
avail_min updates, 64bit kernel (in compat mode) reads directly as:

	u64 appl_ptr;
	u64 avail_min;

Hence a bogus appl_ptr would be passed if avail_min != 0.
And usually application sets non-zero avail_min.
That is, the bug must hit more severely if the new API were really
used.  It wouldn't crash, but some weird streaming behavior can
happen like noise, jumping or underruns.

(Reading back avail_min=0 to user-space is rather harmless.  Ditto for
 the case of BE, then at least there is no appl_ptr corruption.)

This made me wonder which way to go:
it's certainly possible to fix the new kernel to treat both buggy and
sane formats (disabling compat mmap and re-define ioctls, having the
code for old APIs).  The problem is, however, in the case where the
application needs to run on the older kernel that expects the buggy
format.  Then apps would still have to send in the old buggy format --
or maybe better in the older 32bit format that won't hit the bug
above.  It makes situation more complicated.

Do we know how widely the __USE_TIME_BITS64 is deployed nowadays?
