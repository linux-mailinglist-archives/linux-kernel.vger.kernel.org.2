We are actually already using dma_resv_lock() since a few release
cycles back.. msm_gem_lock() and friends are a wrapper around that
from the migration away from using our own lock).. the mm_lock is
symply protecting the lists, not the objects

I guess if gem_shmem users aren't already using resv lock, moving in
that directly would be a good idea.  Maybe it would make sense to
build more object state tracking into gem_shmem helpers (ie. so you
can know which buffers are active/purgable/unpinnable/etc without
traversing a list of *all* gem objects).. that seems like pushing it
more in the direction of being ttm-style frameworky compared to the
simple helper API that it is now.  But maybe that is a good thing?
