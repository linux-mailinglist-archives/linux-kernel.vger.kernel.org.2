You should be able to now that I've added support for per-cpu wakeup timers.

As long as the Arm arch timer is marked as C3STOP (e.g. by sticking the
"local-timer-stop" property in the DT notes), then the MCT will be used
as the wakeup source if you set the CLOCK_EVT_FEAT_PERCPU feature flag.

Give it a try.
