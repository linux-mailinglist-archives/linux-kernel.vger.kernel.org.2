Do you mean the frequency/thermal budget?

I mean the immense slowdown you get if you use %xmm registers after
their %ymm counterparts (doesn't have to be %zmm, that issue is
present starting with AVX) and you have not issued VZEROALL or
VZEROUPPER between the two uses.

It's a bit like EMMS, I gues, only that you don't get corruption, just
really poor performance.

Apparently yes.

It's a standard laptop after a suspend/resume cycle.  It's either a
kernel or firmware bug.

XTEST doesn't abort transactions, but it traps without RTM support.
If CPU0 has RTM support and we enable XTEST use in glibc based on that
(because the startup code runs on CPU0), then the XTEST instruction
must not trap when running on other CPUs.

Currently, we do not use RTM for anything in glibc by default, even if
it is available according to CPUID.  (There are ways to opt in, unless
the CPU is on the disallow list due to the early Haswell bug.)  I'm
worried that if we start executing XTEST on all CPUs that indicate RTM
support, we will see lots of weird issues, along the lines of bug 27398.
