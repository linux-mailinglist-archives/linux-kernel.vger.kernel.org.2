The slot check is mainly there to prevent attempts to "recover"
devices that have been surprise removed (i.e NVMe hot-unplug). The
actual recovery process operates off the eeh_pe tree which is frozen
in place when an error is detected. If a pci_dev is added or removed
it's not really a problem since those are only ever looked at when
notifying drivers which is done with the rescan_remove lock held. That
said, I wouldn't really encourage anyone to follow the EEH model since
it's pretty byzantine.

IMO the real problem is removing and re-adding the pci_dev. I think
it's something that's done largely because the PCI core doesn't really
provide any better mechanism for getting a device back into a
known-good state so it's abused to implement error recovery. This is
something that's always annoyed me since it conflates recovery with
hotplug. After a hot-(un)plug we might have a different device or no
device. In the recovery case we expect to start and end with the same
device. Why not apply the same logic to the pci_dev?

Something I was tinkering with before I left IBM was re-working the
way EEH handles recovering devices that don't have a driver with error
handling callbacks to something like:

1. unbind the driver
2. pci_save_state()
3. do the reset
4. pci_restore_state()
5. re-bind the driver

That would allow keeping the pci_dev around and let me delete a pile
of confusing code which handles binding the eeh_dev to the new
pci_dev. The obvious problem with that approach is the assumption the
device is functional enough to allow saving the config space, but I
don't think that's a deal breaker. We could stash a copy of the device
state before we allow drivers to attach and use that to restore the
device after the reset. The end result would be the same known-good
state that we'd get after a re-scan.

Would that work if there was an error on a device without a driver
bound? If you're just trying to stop races between recovery and device
removal then pci_dev_is_added() is probably the right tool for the
job. Trying to substitute it with a proxy seems like a bad idea.
