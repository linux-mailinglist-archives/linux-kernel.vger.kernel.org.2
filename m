I re-read this discussion and in general I support your position.
As far as I understand your opponents cannot explain why "random kill" is mandatory here,
they are just afraid that it might be useful here and do not want to remove it completely.

Ok, let's allow him to do it. Moreover I'm ready to keep it as default behavior.

However I would like to have some choice in this point.

In general we can:
- continue to use "random kill" and rely on the wisdom of the ancestors.
- do nothing, repeat #PF and rely on fate: "nothing bad will happen if we do it again".
- add some (progressive) killable delay, rely on good will of (unkillable) neighbors and wait for them to release required memory.
- mark the current task as cycled in #PF and somehow use this mark in allocator
- make sure that the current task is really cycled, have no progress, send him fatal signal to kill it and break the cycle.
- implement any better ideas,
- use any combination of previous points

We can select required strategy for example via sysctl.

For me "random kill" is worst choice, 
Why can't we just kill the looped process instead?
It can be marked as oom-unkillable, so OOM-killer was unable to select it.
However I doubt it means "never kill it", for me it is something like "last possible victim" priority.

Thank you,
