Hi Jason,

This requires the mdev driver to obtain a list of allowed PASIDs(possibly
during PASID bind time) prior to do enforcement. IMHO, the PASID enforcement
points are:
1. During WQ configuration (e.g.program MSI)
2. During work submission

For VT-d shared workqueue, there is no way to enforce #2 in mdev driver in
that the PASID is obtained from PASID MSR from the CPU and submitted w/o
driver involvement. The enforcement for #2 is in the KVM PASID translation
table, which is per VM.

For our current VFIO mdev model, bind guest page table does not involve
mdev driver. So this is a gap we must fill, i.e. include a callback from
mdev driver?

Yes, we can take the security role off ioasid_set once we have per mdev
list. However, ioasid_set being a per VM/mm entity also bridge
communications among kernel subsystems that don't have direct call path.
e.g. KVM, VDCM and IOMMU.

Right, we will need some mediation for PF/VF.

Host and guest PASID value, as well as device info are available through
iommu_uapi_sva_bind_gpasid(), we just need to feed that info to mdev driver.

why? would it be cleaner if it is in the common code?
