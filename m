I'm in favor of doing that. But if   ("s390/vfio-ap: fix
circular lockdep when setting/clearing crypto masks") ain't buggy,
then this patch does not qualify for stable. For a complete set of
rules consult:
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/process/stable-kernel-rules.rst

Here the most relevant points:
* It must fix a real bug that bothers people (not a, "This could be a
problem..." type thing).
* t must fix a problem that causes a build error (but not for things
marked CONFIG_BROKEN), an oops, a hang, data corruption, a real security
issue, or some "oh, that's not good" issue. In short, something critical.
* No "theoretical race condition" issues, unless an explanation of how
the race can be exploited is also provided.

Jason may give it another try to convince us that 0cc00c8d4050 only
silenced lockdep, but vfio_ap remained prone to deadlocks. To my best
knowledge using condition variable and a mutex is one of the well known
ways to implement an rwlock. 

In my opinion, you should drop the fixes tag, drop the cc stable, and
provide a patch description that corresponds to *your* understanding
of the situation.

Neither the Fixes tag or the stable process is (IMHO) meant for these
types of (style) issues. And if you don't think the alleged problem is
real, don't make the description of your patch say it is real.

Halil
