Yes, sys_cacheflush() only does what it says on the tin (and only
correctly for hardware broadcast -- everything except 11mpcore).

It only invalidates the caches, but not the per CPU derived state like
prefetch buffers and micro-op buffers, and certainly not instructions
already in flight.

So anything OoO needs at the very least a complete pipeline stall
injected, but probably something stronger to make it flush the buffers.

I really don't understand why you hate the thing so much; SYNC_CORE is a
means of injecting whatever instruction is required to flush all uarch
state related to instructions on all theads (not all CPUs) of a process
as efficient as possible.

The alternative is sending signals to all threads (including the
non-running ones) which is known to scale very poorly indeed, or, as
Mark suggests above, have very expensive instructions unconditinoally in
the instruction stream, which is also undesired.
