Very good, thank you!

I queued this for v5.16 (not the upcoming merge window, but the one after
that) and for review and further testing.  I did a little wordsmithing,
so could you please check to make sure that I didn't mess something up?

							Thanx, Paul

commit 2717b14fb5fc57e5f131cc0bac26c85fc03a0cd2

    rcu-tasks: Fix IPI failure handling in trc_wait_for_one_reader
    
    The trc_wait_for_one_reader() function is called at multiple stages
    of trace rcu-tasks GP function, rcu_tasks_wait_gp():
    
    - First, it is called as part of per task function -
      rcu_tasks_trace_pertask(), for all non-idle tasks. As part of per task
      processing, this function add the task in the holdout list and if the
      task is currently running on a CPU, it sends IPI to the task's CPU.
      The IPI handler takes action depending on whether task is in trace
      rcu-tasks read side critical section or not:
    
      - a. If the task is in trace rcu-tasks read side critical section
           (t->trc_reader_nesting != 0), the IPI handler sets the task's
           ->trc_reader_special.b.need_qs, so that this task notifies exit
           from its outermost read side critical section (by decrementing
           trc_n_readers_need_end) to the GP handling function.
           trc_wait_for_one_reader() also increments trc_n_readers_need_end,
           so that the trace rcu-tasks GP handler function waits for this
           task's read side exit notification. The IPI handler also sets
           t->trc_reader_checked to true, and no further IPIs are sent for
           this task, for this trace rcu-tasks grace period and this
           task can be removed from holdout list.
    
      - b. If the task is in the process of exiting its trace rcu-tasks
           read side critical section, (t->trc_reader_nesting < 0), defer
           this task's processing to future calls to trc_wait_for_one_reader().
    
      - c. If task is not in rcu-task read side critical section,
           t->trc_reader_nesting == 0, ->trc_reader_checked is set for this
           task, so that this task is removed from holdout list.
    
    - Second, trc_wait_for_one_reader() is called as part of post scan, in
      function rcu_tasks_trace_postscan(), for all idle tasks.
    
    - Third, in function check_all_holdout_tasks_trace(), this function is
      called for each task in the holdout list, but only if there isn't
      a pending IPI for the task (->trc_ipi_to_cpu == -1). This function
      removed the task from holdout list, if IPI handler has completed the
      required work, to ensure that the current trace rcu-tasks grace period
      either waits for this task, or this task is not in a trace rcu-tasks
      read side critical section.
    
    Now, considering the scenario where smp_call_function_single() fails in
    first case, inside rcu_tasks_trace_pertask(). In this case,
    ->trc_ipi_to_cpu is set to the current CPU for that task. This will
    result in trc_wait_for_one_reader() getting skipped in third case,
    inside check_all_holdout_tasks_trace(), for this task. This further
    results in ->trc_reader_checked never getting set for this task,
    and the task not getting removed from holdout list. This can cause
    the current trace rcu-tasks grace period to stall.
    
    Fix the above problem, by resetting ->trc_ipi_to_cpu to -1, on
    smp_call_function_single() failure, so that future IPI calls can
    be send for this task.
    
    Note that all three of the trc_wait_for_one_reader() function's
    callers (rcu_tasks_trace_pertask(), rcu_tasks_trace_postscan(),
    check_all_holdout_tasks_trace()) hold cpu_read_lock().  This means
    that smp_call_function_single() cannot race with CPU hotplug, and thus
    should never fail.  Therefore, also add a warning in order to report
    any such failure in case smp_call_function_single() grows some other
    reason for failure.
