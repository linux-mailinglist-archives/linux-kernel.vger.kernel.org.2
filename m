Also for hugetlb migration when memory compaction, we've already counted the number of pages for a hugetlb into cc->nr_migratepages, if the hugetlb migration failed, the trace stat of compaction will be confusing if we return the number of hugetlb.

I am not sure if we should change the manpage, since the THP already did, but I can send a patch to update the manpage if you think this is still necessary. Thanks.

Meanwhile the THP page can be split into normal pages during migration, so it will not be consistent if we return the number of THP.

Right.

Yes.

OK, sounds reasonable to me, I can try it. Thanks for your input.
