IIUC this solution is designed to identify cases when oomd/lmkd got
stuck while allocating memory due to memory shortages and therefore
can't feed the watchdog. In such a case the kernel goes ahead and
kills some processes to free up memory and unblock the blocked
process. Effectively this would limit the time such a process gets
stuck by the duration of the watchdog timeout. If my understanding of
this proposal is correct, then I see the following downsides:
1. oomd/lmkd are still not prevented from being stuck, it just limits
the duration of this blocked state. Delaying kills when memory
pressure is high even for short duration is very undesirable. I think
having mempool reserves could address this issue better if it can
always guarantee memory availability (not sure if it's possible in
practice).
2. What would be performance overhead of this watchdog? To limit the
duration of a process being blocked to a small enough value we would
have to have quite a small timeout, which means oomd/lmkd would have
to wake up quite often to feed the watchdog. Frequent wakeups on a
battery-powered system is not a good idea.
3. What if oomd/lmkd gets stuck for some memory-unrelated reason and
can't feed the watchdog? In such a scenario the kernel would assume
that it is stuck due to memory shortages and would go on a killing
spree. If there is a sure way to identify when a process gets stuck
due to memory shortages then this could work better.
4. Additional complexity of keeping the list of potential victims in
the kernel. Maybe we can simply reuse oom_score to choose the best
victims?
Thanks,
Suren.
