So if we look at ccw, you say that the revision negotiation already
determines whether VERSION_1 is negotiated or not, and the
feature bit VERSION_1 is superfluous?

That would also imply, that 
1) if revision > 0 was negotiated then the device must offer VERSION_1
2) if revision > 0 was negotiated and the driver cleared VERSION_1
   the device must refuse to operate.
3) if revision > 0 was negotiated then the driver should reject 
   to drive a device if it does not offer VERSION_1
4) if revision > 0 was negotiated the driver must accept VERSION_1
5) if revision > 0 was *not* negotiated then the device should not offer
   VERSION_1 because at this point it is already certain that the device
   can not act in accordance to the virtio 1.0 or higher interface.

Does that sound about right?

IMHO we should also change 
https://docs.oasis-open.org/virtio/virtio/v1.1/cs01/virtio-v1.1-cs01.html#x1-160003
and the definition of VERSION_1 because both sides have to know what is
going on before features are fully negotiated. Or?

Halil
