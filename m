Not sure what you mean by that.

The idea was that this would only be enabled if dynamic debug is enabled
and that the DEFINE_DYNAMIC_DEBUG_METADATA() could be used at the
tracepoint function location (trace_foo()) by the tracepoint macros. And
then if one of the callbacks registered for the tracepoint had a
"dynamic_debug" flag set, it would be passed the descriptor in as a pointer.

And then, for example, the filtering logic of ftrace could then reference
the information of the event, if the user passed in something special.

 # echo 'DEBUG_FILE ~ "drivers/soc/qcom/*"' > events/rwmmio/rwmmio_write/filter
 # echo 1 > events/rwmmio/rwmmio_write/enable

And then only the rwmmio_write events that came from the qcom directory
would be printed.

We would create special event fields like "DEBUG_FILE", "DEBUG_FUNC",
"DEBUG_MOD", "DEBUG_LINE", etc, that could be used if dyndebug is enabled
in the kernel.

Of course this is going to bloat the kernel as it will create a dynamic
debug descriptor at every tracepoint location.
