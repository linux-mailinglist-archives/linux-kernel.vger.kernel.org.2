So let's consider the added alloc/free fast paths overhead:
- Patch 1 - __alloc_pages_bulk() used to determine pcp_list once, now it's
determined for each allocated page in __rmqueue_pcplist().
- Patch 2 - adds indirection from pcp->$foo to pcp->lp->$foo in each operation
- Patch 3
  - extra irqsave/irqrestore in free_pcppages_bulk (amortized)
  - rcu_dereference_check() in free_unref_page_commit() and __rmqueue_pcplist()

BTW - I'm not sure if the RCU usage is valid here.

The "read side" (normal operations) is using:
rcu_dereference_check(pcp->lp,
		lockdep_is_held(this_cpu_ptr(&pagesets.lock)));

where the lockdep parameter according to the comments for
rcu_dereference_check() means

"indicate to lockdep that foo->bar may only be dereferenced if either
rcu_read_lock() is held, or that the lock required to replace the bar struct
at foo->bar is held."

but you are not taking rcu_read_lock() and the "write side" (remote
draining) actually doesn't take pagesets.lock, so it's not true that the
"lock required to replace ... is held"? The write side uses
rcu_replace_pointer(...,
			mutex_is_locked(&pcpu_drain_mutex))
which is a different lock.

IOW, synchronize_rcu_expedited() AFAICS has nothing (no rcu_read_lock() to
synchronize against? Might accidentally work on !RT thanks to disabled irqs,
but not sure about with RT lock semantics of the local_lock...

So back to overhead, if I'm correct above we can assume that there would be
also rcu_read_lock() in the fast paths.

The alternative proposed by tglx was IIRC that there would be a spinlock on
each cpu, which would be mostly uncontended except when draining. Maybe an
uncontended spin lock/unlock would have lower overhead than all of the
above? It would be certainly simpler, so I would probably try that first and
see if it's acceptable?
