This patch (and the 18 preceding it) didn't make the cutoff for the
just-past merge window.  If this patch is urgent, please let me know
and I can push it, with luck by the end of next week.

If that one is urgent, are these two also?

817690fd18af ("rcu: Do not disable GP stall detection in rcu_cpu_stall_reset()")
9ed9bf0d17cd ("rcu: Start timing stall repetitions after warning complete")

If so, it is better to handle them as a group than separately.

The cutoff for a given merge window is normally shortly after the close
of the previous merge window.  This time, I am a bit slow creating
branches, but the cutoff for the v5.15 merge window should be by the
end of the week.  This is a bit more lag than most subsystems, but
this is after all RCU.

As always, if a given commit is urgent, please let me know and I
will see what I can do to fast-track it.

For reference:

https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/paulmck/rcutodo.html

Again, if this one needs to hit mainline before the v5.15 merge
window, please let me know.

							Thanx, Paul
