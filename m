I agree u16 is OK.

A minor concern, is it better we also change the dfl_res_off to u16?
dfl_res_off & voff are the same type of variables needed on positioning
the DFL, so I'd like them listed together.

I agree. The vendor_id should be checked before VSEC ID is meaningful,
and now this Vendor/VSEC pair is the only supported one, so this piece of
code is good to me.

A generic Vendor/VSEC pair means all vendors must use the unified
vendor_id if they want to use DFL. I'm not sure if this is proper.
