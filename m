Another option would be to check lock_is_held(&rcu_sched_lock_map)
anywhere preemption is enabled and lock_is_held(&rcu_bh_lock_map)
anywhere BH is enabled.  This would (in theory, anyway) catch more bugs.

But it is necessary to be careful because these checks must be suppressed
if lockdep has been disabled due to a prior lockdep splat.  Otherwise,
the first lockdep splat is followed by an inundation of false-positive
complaints.

But the real question is "Which important bugs are missed today, and
what change would catch them more reliably?"

Thoughts?
