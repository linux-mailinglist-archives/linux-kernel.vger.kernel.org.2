I didn't ask for it to be painted. Unless it is for everyone, I don't
care unless there's some clear pattern used already.

The example is right. The dts is wrong.

Perhaps we need a schema for 'any node name that doesn't match already
defined ones'.

I'm not talking about *just* QCom. If we define something here, it's

In summary, you can't use 'memory' or anything other established,
standard node name.
