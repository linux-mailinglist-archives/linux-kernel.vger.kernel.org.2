We would flush the kwork that's doing discard in this patch.
That's done in ext4_should_retry_alloc()

We're running ext4 with discard on a nbd device whose backend is storage
cluster. The discard can help to free the unused space to storage pool.

And sometimes application delete a lot of data and discard is flooding. 
Then we see the jbd2 commit kthread is blocked for a long time. Even
move the discard out of jbd2, we still see the write IO of jbd2 log
could be blocked. blk-wbt could help to relieve this. Finally the delay
is shift to allocation path. But this is better than blocking the page
fault path which holds the read mm->mmap_sem.
