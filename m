Then FPGA manager driver, one of Intel service layer driver's client, can decide whether to handle the newly added bitstream authentication function based on the retrieved firmware version. So that we can maintain FPGA manager driver the back compatible.

I discussed with Russ and studies his patches, came to realize that the 
work we had to accomplish was not same or similar. What I want to 
achieve is to verify the identity of the bitstream, which is like doing 
a "dry-run" to FPGA configuration.

Performing FPGA configuration (full or partial) through the device tree 
overlay is a method widely used by our customers.

Russ's approach utilizes a different user API which is a set of sysfs files.

If we depart from device tree overlay, then the end-user must utilize 2 
different mechanism or APIs (device tree overlay is used for 
full/partial configuration, and sysfs is used for bitstream 
authentication). Similarly low-level FPGA manager driver also needs to 
add additional codes. For the end-user the single and simple mechanism 
is always better choice, device tree overlay should be a better way to 
achieve that goal.

Richard
