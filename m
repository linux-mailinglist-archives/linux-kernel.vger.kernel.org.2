Hi Jonathan!

Sorry to bring the following up, as I saw you mentioning in another mail
on linux-doc you have a lot on your plate already. I really would prefer
to not add something to it, but something came up.

My vague hope had been to get this patchset merged for 5.13-rc1 and
after its release post the text to Greg, Sasha, ksummit-list and LKML
for a round of really public review. That would make sure at least all
the important maintainers are aware of the text and have a chance to
intervene before it gets fully official. Depending on the outcome I had
hoped to remove the the two last remaining "FIXME" boxes and the "WIP"
box at the top of reporting-issues.rst for 5.14-rc1 and also remove
reporting-bugs.rst.




But a few days ago Konstantin put a visible admonition on the front of

bugzilla.kernel.org that links to the rendered version of
reporting-issues.rst â€“ for context see

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAMwyc-Sqbkg=VxCWcfRazkGG7vkwEQ43m9Dov_Nawia5MN_oUQ@mail.gmail.com/

And then Tytso brought up that it might be a good time to bless the
text: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/YFovanxCgq1lF4Ah@mit.edu/



That's why I'd like to speed things up a little. But for that it would
be good to have something from you: a kind of "I like the direction
where this patch set is heading and I'm optimistic that we get it merged
for 5.13-rc1" message from you. With something like that I could move
ahead as outlined above already. Do you maybe have a minute for that?

Ciao, Thorsten
