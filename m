Then you don't have any leaks relating to branch tracing.

It's just a general property that if some code that is handling secrets
is data dependent it already leaks.

There's no victim with branch tracing, unless it is already leaky.

For a useful security mitigation you need a threat model first I would say.

So you need to have at least some idea how an attack with branch
tracing would work.

I don't think it's needed for instruction tracing.
