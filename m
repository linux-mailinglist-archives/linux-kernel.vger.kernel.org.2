When I say "call", I'm including tracing in that. If a function is not=20
marked as no trace, then it will call into the tracing subsystem.

Right, so it'll be out of whack again.

If they depend on sched_clock that's one thing. Do they definitely have=20
no dependencies on mftb from other calls?

Yes, so I agree with Michael any function that is involved when we begin=20
to switch into guest context (or have not completed switching back to=20
host going the other way) should be marked as no trace (noinstr even,=20
perhaps).

Yeah I meant a default n thing under powerpc kernel debugging somewhere.

Thanks,
