a) I think that syzbot reboots the VM between executing different tests to
get reproducible conditions. But in theory I agree the test may have
contained one image with and one image without a journal.

*but*

b) as I wrote in the email you are replying to, the jbd2_handle key is
private per filesystem. Thus for lockdep to complain about
jbd2_handle->fs_reclaim->jbd2_handle deadlock, those jbd2_handle lockdep
maps must come from the same filesystem.

*and*

c) filesystem without journal doesn't use jbd2_handle lockdep map at all so
for such filesystems lockdep creates no dependency for jbd2_handle map.
