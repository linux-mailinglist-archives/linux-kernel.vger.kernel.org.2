Hi, sorry for a late reply but I couldn't answer earlier.

Initially remoteproc is loaded into it's own reserved-memory region
but qcom decided that they sometimes need more memory than that.
Memshare driver in msm8916 downstream tree seem to blindly allocate
DMA region for every request that it gets. Additionally for those
clients described in the DT, they do the DMA allocation on boot
time and never free the region. They call it "guaranteed" allocation.

On msm8916 only one "guaranteed" client seem to be used so I decided
to implement it with reserved-memory node. On newer platforms they
seem to have more clients but I think that the driver can be easily
extended to support dynamic allocation if someone really needs it.

I tried to explain that in the cover letter but I think I made some
mistake as I don't see it in the Patchwork.

The requests from the remote nodes contain client-id and proc-id
that are supposed to differentiate the clients. It's possible to
find the values in downstream DT or by observing what messages
are received by the memshare service (I left dev_dbg logging in
the driver for that reason)

I think I should reword it to make this more apparent, maybe
"Proc-ID that clients in this node send."?

As with proc-id, maybe reword to "ID that this client sends."?

I will change those in v2, I still expect comments on the driver
itself, so I'll wait for that before submitting it with just a
couple lines changed.

If I understand this correctly, each reserved-memory node will
then load a new instance of memshare. Since the driver registers a
QMI service that handles multiple clients, there should be only one
instance. Additionally, as I mentioned earlier, some clients may not
need reserved-memory at all
