After the LUKS data corruption issue was reported I decided to take a
look at the dm-crypt code. In that code I found the following:

static void clone_init(struct dm_crypt_io *io, struct bio *clone)
{
	struct crypt_config *cc = io->cc;

	clone->bi_private = io;
	clone->bi_end_io  = crypt_endio;
	bio_set_dev(clone, cc->dev->bdev);
	clone->bi_opf	  = io->base_bio->bi_opf;
}
[ ... ]
static struct bio *crypt_alloc_buffer(struct dm_crypt_io *io, unsigned size)
{
	[ ... ]
	clone = bio_alloc_bioset(GFP_NOIO, nr_iovecs, &cc->bs);
	[ ... ]
	clone_init(io, clone);
	[ ... ]
	for (i = 0; i < nr_iovecs; i++) {
		[ ... ]
		bio_add_page(clone, page, len, 0);

		remaining_size -= len;
	}
	[ ... ]
}

My interpretation is that crypt_alloc_buffer() allocates a bio,
associates it with the underlying device and clones a bio. The input bio
may have a size up to UINT_MAX while the new limit for the size of the
cloned bio is max_sectors * 512. That causes bio_add_page() to fail if
the input bio is larger than max_sectors * 512, hence the data
corruption. Please note that this is a guess only and that I'm not
familiar with the dm-crypt code.

Bart.
