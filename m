Subject: [PATCH] mhi: add MHI_STATE_M2 to resume success criteria
Date:   Tue, 20 Apr 2021 11:53:39 +0800
Message-Id: <20210420035339.282963-1-bqiang@codeaurora.org>

During system resume, mhi driver triggers M3->M0 transition and then waits
for target device to enter M0 state. Once done, the device queues a state
change event into ctrl event ring and notify mhi dirver by raising an
interrupt, where a tasklet is scheduled to process this event. In most cases,
the taklet is served timely and wait operation succeeds.

However, there are cases where CPU is busy and can not serve this tasklet
for some time. Once delay goes long enough, the device moves itself to M1
state and also interrupts mhi driver after inserting a new state change
event to ctrl ring. Later CPU finally has time to process the ring, however
there are two events in it now:
	1. for M3->M0 event, which is processed first as queued first,
	   tasklet handler updates device state to M0 and wakes up the task,
	   i.e., the mhi driver.
	2. for M0->M1 event, which is processed later, tasklet handler
	   triggers M1->M2 transition and updates device state to M2 directly,
	   then wakes up the mhi driver(if still sleeping on this wait queue).
Note that although mhi driver has been woken up while processing the first
event, it may still has no chance to run before the second event is processed.
In other words, mhi driver has to keep waiting till timeout cause the M0 state
has been missed.

Fix this issue by simply adding M2 as a valid state for resume.
