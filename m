MY WARM GREETINGS,

I AM MRS.ELIZABETH ROBINSON, I DECIDED TO DONATE WHAT I HAVE TO YOU
FOR INVESTMENT TOWARDS THE GOOD WORK OF CHARITY ORGANIZATION, AND ALSO
TO HELP THE MOTHERLESS AND THE LESS PRIVILEGED ONES AND TO CARRY OUT A
CHARITABLE WORKS IN YOUR COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD ON MY BEHALF.

I AM DIAGNOSING OF THROAT CANCER, HOSPITALIZE FOR GOOD 2 YEARS AND
SOME MONTHS NOW AND QUITE OBVIOUS THAT I HAVE FEW DAYS TO LIVE, AND I
AM A WIDOW NO CHILD; I DECIDED TO WILL/DONATE THE SUM OF $5.8 MILLION
PRIVILEGE AND ALSO FORTH ASSISTANCE OF THE WIDOWS. AT THE MOMENT I
CANNOT TAKE ANY TELEPHONE CALLS RIGHT NOW DUE TO THE FACT THAT M
RELATIVES (THAT HAVE SQUANDERED THE FUNDS FOR THIS PURPOSE BEFORE) ARE
AROUND ME AND MY HEALTH STATUS ALSO. I HAVE ADJUSTED MY WILL AND MY
BANK IS AWARE.

I HAVE WILLED THOSE PROPERTIES TO YOU BY QUOTING MY PERSONAL FILE
ROUTING AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION. AND I HAVE ALSO NOTIFIED THE BANK
THAT I AM WILLING THAT PROPERTIES TO YOU FOR A GOOD, EFFECTIVE AND
PRUDENT WORK. IT IS RIGHT TO SAY THAT I HAVE BEEN DIRECTED TO DO THIS
BY GOD. I WILL BE GOING IN FOR A SURGERY SOON AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT I MAKE THIS DONATION BEFORE UNDERGOING THIS SURGERY.

I WILL NEED YOUR SUPPORT TO MAKE THIS DREAM COME THROUGH, COULD YOU
LET ME KNOW YOUR INTEREST TO ENABLE ME GIVE YOU FURTHER INFORMATION.
AND I HEREBY ADVICE TO CONTACT ME BY THIS EMAIL ADDRESS.

WAITING YOUR REPLY
MRS.ELIZABETH ROBINSON
