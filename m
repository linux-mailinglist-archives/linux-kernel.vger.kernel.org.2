Hi Sudeep,

I'm goignt to post V7 with all the remarks on the series from you and Peter
addressed.  A few notes beow on this patch.

Yes I added a comment explaining the situation, but, my bad, the 'good'
size that fits the HT into a 4k page is indeed 512 (9) because the HT array
is made of hlist_head (so only one pointer, good I double checked on myself :P)

In V7 I removed mx_info last_token and I'm using last_transfer_id; my
only concern (mostly theoretical I think) is that last_transfer_id is
picked from a global atomic and so it is shared by any platform or
channel instance. (and being global is good for tracing correlation
in fact...)

In particular this means that it is also shared with notifications
(which do not use monotonic seqnums), so that, if a flood of notifs
suddenly kicks in, a lot of transfer_idS would be burnt (for tracing
notifs.. not for seqnums) and any following command will end up picking
a good valid monotonic seqnum BUT far away from the previous one
(i.e. there will be holes in the set of monotonic seqnums): no issue
with that but it could lead, under some very awkward limit conditions,
to an early reuse of seqnums for commands (i.e. a less effective
mitigation of seqnums reusing).

Anyway in my tests on this new version I have see no issues and the
above mentioned case is clearly borderline so I made the change (and
noted the above scenario in a comment)

Thanks,
Cristian
