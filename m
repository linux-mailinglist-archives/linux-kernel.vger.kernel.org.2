It's basically a tiny bit of busy work. Ulf and I planned to fix it
and we know how to. Just haven't gotten around to it since it doesn't
really break anything.

That's the point. Because there's no way to tell without the driver
involvement, we basically need to ignore all dependencies between
those two devices pointing at each other.

It's info, not warning if I'm not mistaken. If that's really a problem
we can make it a debug log. Not the end of the world.

Let me take a closer look at this before the end of this week. Can you
point me to the exact DT changes that were made that's causing this
issue? It should help me debug the issue. I have a guess on what the
issue might be.

Right, because it's not a device link yet. It's waiting for the device
to show up to create the device link (it has to for the grand scheme
of things to work correctly).

I sent out some patches to make this easier. But doesn't look like
it'll land in 5.15.

Even if the original case doesn't need remote-endpoint to work
correctly and the cycle has been broken, that doesn't remove the need
for parsing remote-endpoint. There could be other cases like the
original case.

I'll agree to disagree. I'm sure your issue can be fixed without
removing support for remote-endpoint parsing -- let's work on that
(I've asked for more details above).
