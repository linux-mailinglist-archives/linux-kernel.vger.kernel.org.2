I'd rather not multiplex the output of this file based on some input.
That would also be rather hard to do -- write() and read() are two
different syscalls, so you'd need to track a bool (or something) across
them somehow.

Currently, I doubt there are many scripts in the field that scrape this
info and debugfs is specifically excluded from ABI concerns. If we want
to make it more machine-readable (which sounds like a good thing), then
I suggest we just change the output to something like what you have
above and not worry about preserving the "legacy" output.
