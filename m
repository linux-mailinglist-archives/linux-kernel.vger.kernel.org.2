And as I sent that and was going to close the editor...

In contrast to clk-rpmh we already have a "rate" defined for each
clock in clk-smd-rpm, it's just that we don't let anyone know what it is
for branches.

But with your change of defining recalc_rate() for the branches we would
return 19.2MHz for the tcxo - without specifying a divider.

So your patch can be reduced to simply specifying recalc_rate() - i.e.
the last line in your patch.

I tested this on my sdm660 board, by updating xo_board and ensuring that
all nodes referring to "xo" refers to rpmcc tcxo intead and it boots
just fine. And it's backwards compatible with existing DT!



However, as we specify recalc_rate(), we'd start reporting that all the
buffered XO clocks are ticking at 1kHz, so I suspect that there might be
things that doesn't work. This is done so that rate/1000 becomes 0 or 1
for the branches.

But that will happen with the patch as you have given it as well, until
we've defined all the divs.

In other words, I don't think we should introduce the div, but rather
just rely on the "rate". And for the buffered clocks we need to correct
the rate - while ensuring that we pass a binary enable/rate to the
interface.
