OK, that's a good reason why you need it. However, the desgin is still
be a bit wrong. You should make it as another probe event, because

1. eprobe is not a kprobe but an event converter (reusing fetchargs)
2. we already have dynevent framework for expanding new dynamic events.
3. what you need is the "fetch args", that is shared with uprobe-event
   there is no reason we can't share it with one more probe-event. :)

Thus, I recommend you to introduce a new dynevent, you don't need
to add "eprobe_events" file but you can use "dynamic_events" interface.

OK, for the dereference feature, it may need more careful
implementation. (and maybe need a different parser)

OK, but I want you to create another dynevent, not extending kprobe_events
for non-kprobe things. That will make things much harder to be maintained.

So maybe what you need is trace_eprobe.c, instead of modifying trace_kprobe.c.
