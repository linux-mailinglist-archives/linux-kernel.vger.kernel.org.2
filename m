Thanks!

Per MMC spec, eMMC bus speed is set as legacy mode(0~26MHz) at startup of
eMMC initializtion flow. Clock phase calculation is triggered in set_clock()
and it calculates taps based on phase_deg(<9>, <225>) in the dts file and the
current speed(1562500Hz), which causes the warning message you mentioned.
As the phase_deg in the dts file should be calculated with 100MHz.

https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/5/24/95

But after some initialization flow, eMMC bus speed will be set to
correct speed(100MHz).
Clock phase calculation will be triggered again to get correct taps.
