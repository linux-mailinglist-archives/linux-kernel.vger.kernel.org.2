Personally, I think it would be best to introduce a new, SMC64 only
compatible (e.g. "qcom,scm-64" like I mentioned). Then you can skip the
detection check for the boards that opt-in by adding the compatible.
You can then use it on all newer boards/SoCs/firmwares where you know
exactly that there is SMC64.

I would just like to avoid breaking any existing boards where we don't
know exactly if they have SMC32 or SMC64.

In a perfect world the firmware would do that, but there is certainly
no such mechanism on any of the old SoCs :/

Ah okay, this sounds like a better reason than just trying to avoid the
"overhead" of the detection step. :) I still think it should work if you
just start marking all newer boards/SoCs/... as "qcom,scm-64" or
something like that, right?

Thanks,
Stephan
