Yes, that would be another example.
Also CCing Kees for input, as besides the "kdump ASAP for debugging" case, I can
imagine security hardening folks could be interested in the "somebody might have
just failed to pwn the kernel, better panic than let them continue" angle. But
I'm naive wrt security, so it might be a stupid idea :)
