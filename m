Just to be clear, the above diagnostic is from lockdep rather than KCSAN.

According to the sample crash result, different code paths acquire
jdb2_handle and the __fs_reclaim_map in different orders.  It looks
to me that __fs_reclaim_map isn't really a lock, but rather a mode
indicator.  If so, lockdep should set it up accordingly, perhaps
in a manner similar to rcu_lock_map.

The first thing is to work out what the code should be doing.  What KCSAN
is saying is that a variable is being locklessly updated.  Is it really
OK for that variable to be locklessly updated?  If not, a larger fix
is required.

For more information, please see Marco's LWN series:
https://lwn.net/Articles/816850/ and https://lwn.net/Articles/816854/

Alternatively, you can refer to the documentation being proposed for
the Linux kernel tree:

If the above information doesn't help the bug explorers, please let me
know.
