A bit of a formality: keep in mind that you cannot add Reviewed-by: to
patches unless explicitly given by the reviewer.  They do not represent
that a person has at some point given you a review on the patch; rather
they indicate that the reviewer in question has checked and agreed with
the changes.

In other words, after Konrad has reviewed your patches you should resend
a fixed version without his Reviewed-by:.  He'll reply with this line
once he has seen and acknowledged the resulting changes (or otherwise
reply with more requests for changes).  The maintainer picks these up
when applying the patchset to the tree, but you should pick them up
yourself if/when resending a new version.

Finally, this is a bit tricky but you should technically drop every
Reviewed-by: whenever a patch is changed in a followup patchset, leaving
it up to the reviewers to acknowledge that they are also okay with the
updated patch.
