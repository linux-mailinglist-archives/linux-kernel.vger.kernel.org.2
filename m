Yes, this last, which is in the grace-period kthread code, for example,
in rcu_gp_fqs_loop().

Good to know.  Anything I should worry about for this mode?

Also, the current test expects callbacks to be invoked, which involves a
number of additional kthreads and timers, for example, in nocb_gp_wait().
I suppose I could instead look at grace-period sequence numbers, but I
believe that real-life use cases needing RCU priority boosting also need
the callbacks to be invoked reasonably quickly (as in within hundreds
of milliseconds up through very small numbers of seconds).

Thoughts?
