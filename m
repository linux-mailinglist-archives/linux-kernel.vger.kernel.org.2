Then FPGA manager driver, one of Intel service layer driver's client, can decide whether to handle the newly added bitstream authentication function based on the retrieved firmware version. So that we can maintain FPGA manager driver the back compatible.

Richard and I had an initial conversation today. I'll start looking at how secure operations can be integrated into the fpga manager.

More to come...
