I'm aware that DT is considered firmware and is ""intended"" to be
shipped separately (and probably only once out of the factory) but it
seems so far there's an advantage in updating DT in parallel with the
kernel.  However this is the first time hearing that having dt-bindings
documentation available contributes to considering the DT contract
(more) stable.  Either way I'd expect these bindings to have been fixed
much sooner if it was really actively used.

Great, sending v2 shortly.
