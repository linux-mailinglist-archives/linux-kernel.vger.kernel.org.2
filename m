OK, but how to query the id of the event which has been made
from writing dynamic_events file? (maybe query from name by
ioctl?)

What about using ioctl on 'user_event_status' file?
But in this case, the name is not showing the function.

Then, what about renaming it as simply 'user_events'? :)
This file will show the current user events as similar to synth_events,
in addition, it will show the current status in "# comment".

$ echo "user1 u32 arg1; u64 arg2" > user_events
$ cat user_events
user1 u32 arg1; u64 arg2
$ echo 1 > events/user_events/user1/enable
$ cat user_events
user1 u32 arg1; u64 arg2 # Used by ftrace

In addition, 
- user-process can do ioctl() to query offset instead of id from name.
- user-process can do mmap() the file to monitor the status.

Hmm, I don't think so. You can use an array of the pointer to
events on the private data of the struct file.
When you add (or start using) an event (this is identified by ioctl),
you can increment the event refcount and add it to the array.
When the file is closed (in exiting process), it will loop on the
array and decrement the refcount for each event.
Then, after all tracers disabled the event, ftrace can remove the
event in background (unless it is defined through 'dynamic_events' or
'user_events').

Sorry, that's not doable unless we introduce a new __rel_loc__ attribute
to the ftrace (and libtraceevent). With that, the dynamic data 
(like string) offset can be written as the offset from itself.

Anyway, as far as you are using trace event the data format itself is
the contract between kernel and user, because *kernel* also has to 
decode it (e.g. user will read the 'trace' file.) and other tools
like perf has to decode it too.

The kernel will not modify the data (again with __rel_loc__ attr) but
it will add the common_* field and event ID as a header to its buffer
when record it.

OK, so let's add __rel_loc__ attribute. The rel_loc type will be

struct rel_loc {
	uint16_t len;	/* The data size (including '\0' if string )*/
	uint16_t offs;	/* The offset of actual data from this field */
} __packed;

Hmm, btw, this will be good for probe events... I don't need to pass
the base address with this attribute.

Yeah, we always collaborate on LKML and other MLs :)
