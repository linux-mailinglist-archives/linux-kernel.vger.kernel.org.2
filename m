Yeah, I can think of some hacks as well (like storing a global id->apple_dart* map
or stuffing the 64bit pointer into two ints) and I've tried a few of them in the past
days but didn't like either of them.

I do like the idea to just put two (struct apple_dart *dart, u16 sidmap)
in there though which will be plenty for all current configurations.

So what this feature does is to allow the DART to take an incoming DMA stream
tagged with id i and pretend that it's actually been tagged with
readb(dart->regs + 0x80 + i) instead. That's as much as I can figure out by
poking the hardware. More details are probably only available to Apple.

Now the reason I thought I needed this was that I assumed we are handed these DARTs
in an unclean state because Apple makes use of this internally:
In their device tree they have a sid-remap property which I believe is a hack to make
their driver simpler. The dwc3 controller requires stream 0 of dartA and stream 1 of
dartB to be configured the same way. They configure dartB to remap stream 1 to stream 0
and then just mirror all MMIO writes from dartA to dartB and pretend that dwc3 only
needs a single DART.

As it actually turns out though, iBoot doesn't use the USB DARTs and we already get
them in the sane state. I can just drop this code. (And if we actually need it
for other DARTs I can also just restore those in our bootloader or add it in a
follow up).

Yes, exactly. It's not very nice but it works...

Agreed. That sounds a lot nicer actually.

I've given that one a try and I kinda like it so far :D
I'll keep it for v5 and just drop it in case someone complains.

I can relax the locking quite a bit.
Right now, I only need a spinlock around the TLB flush MMIO writes
and a mutex to protect domain initialization.

That's a very good point, I somehow tried to make this part as general
as possible and didn't realize that this only has to work on essentially
one SoC for now. I also don't expect Apple to require more than two
DARTs for a single master in the future.

I've tried the fixed structure now and I really like it so far.
