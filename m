Reduce duplication in the JSONs by referencing standard events from
armv8-common-and-microarch.json

In general the "PublicDescription" fields are not modified when somewhat
significantly worded differently than the standard.

Apart from that, description and names for events slightly different to
standard are changed (to standard) for consistency.
