I completely agree with you! That's also why I earlier suggested
moving to use an mmc-pwrseq node
(Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mmc/mmc-pwrseq-simple.yaml), that
would allow a better description of the HW.

Nevertheless, the important point is that the mmc core gets a valid
host->ocr_avail to work with during card initialization. And in this
case, it's probably good enough to model this via changing the
regulator-min|max-microvolt to get a proper value from the
"regulator".

That's really great information! During the first initialization
attempt, things are working fine and the SDIO card gets properly
detected.

It looks like the card is being re-initialized when it's time to probe
with the SDIO func driver. This makes sense, assuming it's been
powered off via runtime PM (the "cap-power-off-card" DT property
should be set in the DTS for this card's slot).

I looked a bit closer to understand the problem above and then I
realized why the card->ocr is being set from omap_hsmmc ->init_card()
callback. It's most likely because the mmc core in
mmc_sdio_init_card() doesn't save the card->ocr when
MMC_QUIRK_NONSTD_SDIO is set. Instead it becomes the responsibility
for the ->init_card() callback to do it, which seems wrong to me.

Note that the card->ocr is being used when re-initializing the SDIO card.

I have just sent a patch [1], would you mind trying it, in combination
with not assigning card->ocr in $subject patch?

Thanks a lot for doing these tests! If I am right, it looks like we
should be able to skip assigning card->ocr for this quirk, but let's
see.

Kind regards
