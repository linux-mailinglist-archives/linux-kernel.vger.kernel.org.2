In addition, relying on implicit power-on or boot loader state comes
with its own set of pitfalls, which may break other use cases.
On a heavily power-managed mobile device, clocks and/or power domains
can be turned off, so a kernel launched from kexec or kdump may start
in a state not adhering to these implicit dependencies.
