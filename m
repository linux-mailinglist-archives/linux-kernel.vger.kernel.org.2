Right, I was assuming have three use cases of IOASIDs:
1. host supervisor SVA (not a concern, just one init_mm to bind)
2. host user SVA, either one IOASID per process or perhaps some private
IOASID for private address space
3. VM use for guest SVA, each IOASID is bound to a guest process

My current cgroup proposal applies to #3 with IOASID_SET_TYPE_MM, which is
allocated by the new /dev/ioasid interface.

For #2, I was thinking you can limit the host process via PIDs cgroup? i.e.
limit fork. So the host IOASIDs are currently allocated from the system pool
with quota of chosen by iommu_sva_init() in my patch, 0 means unlimited use
whatever is available. https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/2/28/18
