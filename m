Very nice information.

You may look at micron_8_ecc_get_status() helper to guide you. But
IMHO, if there are 0-3 bf, you should probably assume there were 3 bf
and return 3, if there were 4, return 4, if it's uncorrectable return
-EBADMSG otherwise -EINVAL.

We should verify that this does not mess with UBI wear leveling
though. Please check that returning 3-bit errors no matter the
actual number of flipped bits does not lead UBI to move the data away
(I think it's fine but we need to be sure otherwise the implementation
proposal is not valid).

Thanks,
Miqu√®l
