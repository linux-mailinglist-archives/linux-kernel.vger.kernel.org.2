Yes.  Thanks for pointing that out!

We will update node_demotion[] in CPU hotplug too.  Because the status
that whether a node has CPU may change after CPU hotplug.  And CPU
online/offline performance may be relevant for suspend/resume.

I don't know whether the performance of memory hotplug is important or
not.  But it should be welcome not to make it too bad.  You proposal
sounds good.
