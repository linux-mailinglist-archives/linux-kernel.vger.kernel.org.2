Hi All,

NOTE: This series is not ready for wide public review. It is being
specifically posted so that Peter Z and other experts on the entry
code can look for problems with the new exception handler (#VE).
That's also why x86@ is not being spammed.

Intel's Trust Domain Extensions (TDX) protect guest VMs from malicious
hosts and some physical attacks. This series adds the bare-minimum
support to run a TDX guest. The host-side support will be submitted
separately. Also support for advanced TD guest features like attestation
or debug-mode will be submitted separately. Also, at this point it is not
secure with some known holes in drivers, and also hasnâ€™t been fully audited
and fuzzed yet.

TDX has a lot of similarities to SEV. It enhances confidentiality and
of guest memory and state (like registers) and includes a new exception
(#VE) for the same basic reasons as SEV-ES. Like SEV-SNP (not merged
yet), TDX limits the host's ability to effect changes in the guest
physical address space.

In contrast to the SEV code in the kernel, TDX guest memory is integrity
protected and isolated; the host is prevented from accessing guest
memory (even ciphertext).

The TDX architecture also includes a new CPU mode called
Secure-Arbitration Mode (SEAM). The software (TDX module) running in this
mode arbitrates interactions between host and guest and implements many of
the guarantees of the TDX architecture.

Some of the key differences between TD and regular VM is,

1. Multi CPU bring-up is done using the ACPI MADT wake-up table.
2. A new #VE exception handler is added. The TDX module injects #VE exception
   to the guest TD in cases of instructions that need to be emulated, disallowed
   MSR accesses, subset of CPUID leaves, etc.
3. By default memory is marked as private, and TD will selectively share it with
   VMM based on need.
4. Remote attestation is supported to enable a third party (either the owner of
   the workload or a user of the services provided by the workload) to establish
   that the workload is running on an Intel-TDX-enabled platform located within a
   TD prior to providing that workload data.

You can find TDX related documents in the following link.
