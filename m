Yeah, this is where we come unstuck. We don't always activate kernel
page tables/turn on data relocations/leave real mode/whatever. In some
cases we run in real mode for (I believe) the entire NMI handler.

Fair enough. What exactly are the preconditions for instrumentation?  In
other words, what must the arch ensure is true before we pass an
instrumentation_begin()?

I know from KASAN that we need to be able to access the shadow memory,
which on most (all?) platforms means we need relocations/virtual
addressing on. I don't know what else needs to be satisfied. (I'm
guessing we want to be in a position where taking a fault won't bring
down the system, for example.)

A problem which I too suffer from - I am in no position to throw stones here!

Yeah, so it looks to me that we should not be calling nmi_enter() when
we don't have data relocations on (the mfmsr() & MSR_DR test) - we
shouldn't special case pseries hash guests.

I'll have to think through the implications of that, neither powerpc
exceptions nor Linux's exception handing are really my areas of
expertise!

What's the new interface I'm supposed to be using? Things like
irqentry_nmi_enter?

We take most exceptions (on 64-bit server platforms, at least, and as
currently configured, etc etc) with relocations already on. But there
are 5 interrupts defined in the ISA which we always take with
relocations _off_.

It sounds like we may have been a bit optimistic about how far into the
generic kernel we could go in these cases. I guess the right thing to do
is to handle them quickly, touching only arch-specific known-safe
things, and then get out. But I will read the RCU docs to check what it
expects of us and bikeshed things on the linuxppc-dev list.

Thanks again, I really appreciate the quick, detailed and patient reply!

Kind regards,
Daniel
