Hi Paolo, thanks for your precious time. This is a good question. Now
the pre-group class dominate the per-process class. But thinking about
it in depth now, there seems to be a problem in the container scene,
because the tasks inside the container may have different ioprio class
and ioprio. Maybe Bfq.ioprio should only affects the scheduling of the
group? which can be better compatible with the actual production
environment.

As ioprio is a number, so the ioprio class also uses a number form.
But your suggestion is good. If necessary, I will modify it later.

More discussions are welcome, Thanks.
