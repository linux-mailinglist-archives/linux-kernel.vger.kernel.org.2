I've discussed with Ludovic, and it is somewhat related to this patch set:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-mmc/list/?series=186219&state=%2A&archive=both

The STM32 SDMMC IP needs a specific reset procedure when a data timeout 
occurs. If it is hardware, this is managed with the threaded IRQ. But if 
it is a SW polling (if R1B is replaced with R1), there is nothing in 
frameworks that could call this "unstuck" procedure for STM32 variant.
I don't know how this should be handled.


Regards,
Yann
