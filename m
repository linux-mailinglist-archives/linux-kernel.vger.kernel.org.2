Right, looks like these are needed, after talking to some more folks
I was told RPMh does not really enforce any dependencies on any of the
SoCs, so my earlier statement was wrong that this was managed by RPMh.
Some SoCs just have some digital domain requirements which need these
dependencies to be managed (not all SoCs) and when we end up with such
a situation its almost always expected to be managed by the RPMh masters
(APPS running hlos in this case)
This is not just across cx/mx but others as well like mmcx/mxc/gfx etc.

Unfortunately I could not find this very well documented at an SoC level,
so perhaps the best way to go about is to look at downstream dependencies
and try to match them upstream :/
I will respin this to add the 8150 dependencies back (and if I see any more
for the others)
