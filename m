For Renesas SoCs, we typically only consider compatibility of new
kernels with old DTBs, not the other way around.
However, most DTB updates are due to new hardware support, so using the
new DTB with an old kernel usually just means no newly documented
hardware, or new feature, is being used by the old kernel.

In case there was a real issue fixed, and using the new DTB with the old
kernel would cause a regression, and we're aware of it, we do make sure
the DTS update is postponed until the corresponding driver update has
hit upstream.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
