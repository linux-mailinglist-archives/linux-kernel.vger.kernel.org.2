I *really* don't see the point of having the compiler whine about
"dead code", so I'm not terribly fond of
-Wunreachable-code-aggressive.  There may be times where depending on
how things are compiled, we *want* the compiler to remove code block,
and it makes the code less ugly than having #ifdef ... #endif breaking
up the code.

If turning that on requires uglifying many places in the kernel code,
maybe the right answer is... don't.

That being said, I have no problem of replacing

	if (0) {
		...
	}

with

#ifdef DX_DEBUG
	...
#endif

In this particular place.

But before we go there, I want to register my extreme skepticsm about
-Wunreachable-code-aggressive.  How much other places where it is
***obvious*** that the maintainer really knew what they are doing, and
it's just the compiler whining about a false positive?

If you want to do that, and do something like

#ifdef DX_DEBUG
static inline htree_rep_invariant_Check(...)
{
	...
}
#else
static inline htree_rep_invariant_check(...) { }
#endif

I'm not going to complain.  That's actually a better way to go, since
there may be other places in the code where a developer might want to
introduce a rep invariant check.  So that's actually improving the
code, as opposed to making a pointless change just to suppress a
compiler warning.

Of course, then someone will try enabling a -W flag which causes the
compiler to whine about empty function bodies....
