 I sent this mail praying it will found you in a good condition of
health, since I myself are in a very critical health condition in
which I sleep every night without knowing if I may be alive to see the
next day.I'm Mrs.Monika John Carlsen, wife of late Mr John Carlsen, a
widow suffering from long time illness.i have some funds i inherited
from my late husband, the sum of (elevenmilliondollars) my Doctor told
me recently that I have serious sickness which is cancer problem. What
disturbs me most is my stroke sickness.Having known my condition,I
decided to donate this fund to a good person that will utilize it the
way i am going to instruct herein.I need a very honest and God fearing
person who can claim this money and use it for Charity works,for
orphanages,widows and also build schools for less privileges that will
be named after my late husband if possible and to promote the word of
God and the effort that the house of God is maintained.

I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly
manner.That's why I'm taking this decision. I'm not afraid of death so
I know where I'm going.I accept this decision because I do not have
any child who will inherit this money after I die. Please I want your
sincerely and urgent answer to know if you will be able to execute
this project, and I will give you more information on how the fund
will be transferred to your bank account.I'm waiting for your reply.

Best Regards,
Mrs. Monika John Carlsen
