Hello there,

Good day. I sent you an email a few days ago but I did not=20
receive a reply. I am not sure if you got that email or not. I am=20
Muhammad Faraz. I got your contact from an online business=20
directory and I am contacting you because I have a proposition=20
that could be of great interest to you. I want you to keep an=20
open mind while reading this proposal. I represent the interest=20
of my brother in-law who was a former minister in the Syrian=20
Government. As you probably know, there is a lot of crisis going=20
on currently in that part of the world and my brother in-law has=20
been one of the few people to publicly oppose the Government's=20
policy on this senseless war and killings of innocent citizens=20
and have been trying to advocate for a more peaceful and=20
prosperous country. Unfortunately, his unwavering support for the=20
rebels who are fighting to put an end to the war has caused him=20
to fall out with the ruling party and he now has reasons to be=20
believe that his life is at risk. In order to ensure that his=20
family is taken care of and protected incase anything happens to=20
him, he has asked me to help him find a foreign partner with good=20
business acumen that can help him secure and invest his assets=20
that he has in Europe. This is why I have contacted you. I=20
searched online and saw your profile so I thought you would be=20
interested in this opportunity.

Do you have investment ideas or business projects that these=20
funds can be invested into? Please note that he wants this done=20
very discretely and I will be acting as his eyes and ears during=20
the course of this transaction. He is also prepared to compensate=20
you very much for your efforts so this would be worth your time.=20
If this proposal interests you, kindly respond so that I can give=20
you more details.

Regards,

Muhammad.
