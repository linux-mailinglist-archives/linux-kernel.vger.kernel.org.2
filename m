Hi Jiang,
thanks for re-starting the multi-transport support for dgram!

I agree on this part, I think that's the direction to go.  
transport_dgram was added as a shortcut.

I'm not sure this is right.
The auto_bind on the first packet should only assign a local port to the 
socket, but does not affect the transport to be used.

A user could send one packet to the nested guest and another to the host 
using the same socket, or am I wrong?

yes, this I think is the main problem, but maybe the sender one is even 
more complicated.

Maybe we should remove the 1:1 association we have now between vsk and 
transport.

At least for DGRAM, for connected sockets I think the association makes 
sense.

Yes, they're registered at different times, but it's the same transport.

Yes, I remember we discussed this idea, this would simplify the 
receiving, but there is still the issue of a user wanting to receive 
packets from both the nested guest and the host.

I think one solution could be to remove the 1:1 association between 
DGRAM socket and transport.

IIUC VMCI creates a skb for each received packet and queues it through 
sk_receive_skb() directly in the struct sock.

Then the .dgram_dequeue() callback dequeues them using 
skb_recv_datagram().

We can move these parts in the vsock core, and create some helpers to 
allow the transports to enqueue received DGRAM packets in the same way 
(and with the same format) directly in the struct sock.


What do you think?

Thanks,
Stefano
