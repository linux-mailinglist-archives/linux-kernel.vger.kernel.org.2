I presume you mean dp-opp-table, and you're right, that is perfectly in
line with gpu-opp-table, mdp-opp-table and dsi-opp-table. But there's
also a few examples showing me that there's no need for it to be
globally unique.

So "dp_opp_table: opp-table" is the form I want and we should fix all
those other cases.

I'll update your patch as I apply it, no need to respin it for that.
