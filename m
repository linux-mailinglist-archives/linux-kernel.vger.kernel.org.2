you $ 850,000 in compensation and it will be transferred to your bank

transferred to your BTCI Bank of Togo bank account without any delay
or hassle.

We received the Supreme Court's verdict on your behalf and we passed
it on to BTCI Bank of Togo to open an online account in your name and
give you a username and password so you can access your fund and make
a transfer to the address you provided ... account yourself. You are
hereby advised to contact Mr. Leonard Matthias of BTCI Bank Togo to
open an account in your name and indicate how to make your own bank
transfer to online bank transfer. Please contact BTCI bank immediately
