The cpuset_v2_mode is a change in v1 behavior and that is why it is an 
opt-in as we don't want to break existing applications that have a 
dependency on the current v1 behavior. If users switch to use cgroup v2, 
they get the new behavior. Alternately, they can modify the system 
startup script to use the v2 behavior by using the mount option. I don't 
think we are going to change the v1 default behavior.
