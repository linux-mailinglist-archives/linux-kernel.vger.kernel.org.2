What I mean is: if you want to shoot down lazies instead of doing the
hazard pointer trick to track them, you could do:

#define for_each_possible_lazymm_cpu while (false)

which would promise to the core code that you don't have any lazies left
by the time exit_mmap() is done.  You might need a new hook in
exit_mmap() depending on exactly how you implement the lazy shootdown.
