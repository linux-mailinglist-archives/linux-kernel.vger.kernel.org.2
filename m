So it seems possible that s_dirtyclusters_counter/i_reserved_data_blocks
counters are not maintained anymore when filesystem gets remounted from
'delalloc' to 'nodelalloc', even when you're writing back a (previously)
delay allocated page cache (when it's still mounted as 'delalloc'). Thus
it is possible that s_dirtyclusters_counter/i_reserved_data_blocks
counters are non-zero when the inode is finally evicted and destroyed.

IMHO I think this inconsistency is problematic. For example, when
filesystem gets remounted from 'delalloc' to 'nodelalloc' and then runs
for a period, s_dirtyclusters_counter/i_reserved_data_blocks counters
already gets inconsistent. Then it's remounted back to 'delalloc', in
which case s_dirtyclusters_counter/i_reserved_data_blocks counters are
already incorrect.
