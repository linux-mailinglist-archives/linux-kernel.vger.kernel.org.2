Thanks for great explanation! Now I understand.

I see. Now I understand your patch. Honestly, seeing how fragile is trying
to fix extent tree after split has failed in the middle, I would probably
go even further and make sure we fix the tree properly in case of ENOSPC
and EDQUOT (those are easily user triggerable).  Anything else indicates a
HW problem or fs corruption so I'd rather leave the extent tree as is and
don't try to fix it (which also means we will not create overlapping
extents). So something like:


        err = ext4_ext_insert_extent(handle, inode, ppath, &newex, flags);
-       if (err == -ENOSPC && (EXT4_EXT_MAY_ZEROOUT & split_flag)) {
+       if (err == -ENOSPC || err == -EDQUOT) {
+		if (EXT4_EXT_MAY_ZEROOUT & split_flag)
+			err = handle zeroing...
		if (err) {
			fix extent len
			goto out;
		}
...
	}

and in all other cases just 'goto out' in case of error. What do you think?
