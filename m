Currently it's all just a glue code for dw-hdmi, which is not using a phy
framework and handles both the controller and phy parts. dw-hdmi needs passing
platform data around
(https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/drm/bridge/dw_hdmi.h#L115)
to get a specific set of phy glue callbacks hooked into platform data of dw-hdmi
prior to calling dw_hdmi_probe.

Looking at other users of dw_hdmi_probe this is the only one that has this
unfortunate issue due to using phys binding internally as a part of one device.

Just making it a platform driver will also change the probe order of phy and the
controller, which I've heard from Jernej needs to have the current order of
(controller and then phy) perserved, for some reason, and will make things
still a bit more convoluted.

So this looks like needs quite a bit of thought.
