i915 has had this capability for some years now, and work is in progress
to extract the DP AUX backlight code to drm core as helpers [1]. There's
much more to it than what's proposed here. Adding incompatible DP AUX
code at this point would be a pretty bad outcome.

For example, we can't tie backlight device register to DP AUX backlight,
because there are modes where *both* the eDP PWM pin based backlight
control and DP AUX backlight control are used *simultaneously*. The
backlight device register needs to be in code that is aware of both.

Granted, it was a mistake way back when to add this in i915 only, and it
should've been lifted to drm much earlier. It would've been done by
Lyude by now, but people were not happy about not using drm device based
logging. And that has unfortunately lead to a pretty massive prep series
[2].

Please look into the code added to drm helpers in [1], and see how that
would work for you.


BR,
Jani.
