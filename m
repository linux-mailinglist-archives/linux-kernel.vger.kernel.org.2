You cite the right references, I think the interpretation is too strict.

The specifications require that

a) The DRBG must be seeded by a 90B entropy source

b) The DRBG must be initially seeded with 256 bits of entropy plus some 128=
=20
bit nonce

We cover a) with the Jitter RNG and b) by pulling 384 bits from it.

The standard does not forbit:

c) the entropy string may contain data from another origin or it contains a=
=20
larger buffer

d) the actual entropy distribution in the entropy string being not an=20
equidistribution over the entire entropy string

Bullet d) implies that it is perfectly fine to have entropy distribution be=
gin=20
loopsided in the entropy string.

Bullet c) implies that other data can be provided with the entropy string.

With that, to be 90A/B compliant, you interpret that the Jitter RNG provide=
s=20
all entropy you need and credit the entropy from get_random_bytes with zero=
=20
bits of entropy.


Note, if you look into the implementation of the DRBG seeding, the differen=
t=20
input strings like entropy string or data without entropy like personalizat=
ion=20
string are simply concatenated and handed to the DRBG. As the Jitter RNG an=
d=20
get_random_bytes data is also concatenated, it follows the concepts of 90A.

If you look into the draft 90C standard, it explicitly allows concatenation=
 of=20
data from an entropy source that you credit with entropy and data without=20
entropy - see the crediting of entropy of multiple entropy sources defined=
=20
with "Method 1" and "Method 2" in the current 90C draft.

This ultimately allows us to have an entropy string that is concatenated fr=
om=20
different entropy sources. If you have an entropy source that is not 90B=20
compliant, you have to credit it with zero bits of entropy in the entropy=20
analysis. Thus, only the entropy source(s) compliant to 90B must provide th=
e=20
entire entropy as mandated by 90A.

After having several discussions with the Entropy Working group sponsored b=
y=20
NIST that included also representatives from the NIST crypto technology gro=
up,=20
there was no concern regarding such approach.

This approach you see in the current DRBG seeding code is now taken for=20
different FIPS validations including FIPS validations that I work on as a F=
IPS=20
tester as part of my duties working for a FIPS lab. My colleagues have=20
reviewed the current kernel DRBG seeding strategy and approved of it for ot=
her=20
=46IPS validations.

Ciao
Stephan
