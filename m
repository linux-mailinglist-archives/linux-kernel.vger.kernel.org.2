OK.  So if I understand right, you've got a lot of processes all
calling exit_mmap() at the same time, which eventually becomes calls to
unmap_vmas(), unmap_single_vma(), unmap_page_range(), zap_pte_range(),
tlb_flush_mmu(), tlb_batch_pages_flush(), free_pages_and_swap_cache(),
release_pages(), and then you see high contention on the LRU lock.

Your use-case doesn't seem to mind sleeping (after all, these processes
are exiting).  So we could put a semaphore in exit_mmap() to limit the
number of simultaneous callers to unmap_vmas().  Do you want to try
that out and see if it solves your problem?  You might want to make it
a counting semaphore (eg permit two tasks to exit at once) rather than
a mutex.  But maybe a mutex is just fine.
