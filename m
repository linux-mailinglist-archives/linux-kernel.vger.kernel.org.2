How do we know user provided PASID A was allocated by the ioasid FD?
Shouldn't we validate user input by tracking which PASIDs are allocated by
which ioasid FD? This is one reason why we have ioasid_set and its xarray.

This lookup API seems to be asking for per ioasid FD storage array. Today,
the ioasid_set is per mm and contains a Xarray. Since each VM, KVM can only
open one ioasid FD, this per FD array would be equivalent to the per mm
ioasid_set, right?

Would it be redundant to what iommu_uapi_sva_bind_gpasid() does? I thought
the idea is to use ioasid FD IOCTL to issue IOMMU uAPI calls. Or we can
skip this step for now and wait for the user to do SVA bind.
