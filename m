This will allow also interrupting a user space requist which happens to
trigger a large vmalloc, hence the reason for going for
fatal_signal_pending rather than oom specific condition.

__GFP_NOFAIL semantic is explicitly not supported for vmalloc.

I would keep it sitting in the linux-next for some time to sort out
potential fallouts and have them fixed before this one gets merged.

Thanks!
