There are _at least_ two platforms which are affected by this:
 - Intel Galileo
 - Microsoft Surface 3

For the time being I'm testing this on the former one. If we get
something working there, I will perform similar tests on the latter
one. And who knows how many more platforms are affected, because kexec
is usually not what many people are using every day, however we (my
teammates and I) use such a setup _a lot_.on a number of platforms It
appears that only those two were found in our zoo to behave badly.
