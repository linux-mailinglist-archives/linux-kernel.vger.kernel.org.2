Oh, my bad. I was aiming for about a release per month but I didn't
really pay attention on my own schedule.

Understood.

Speaking with my upstream hat on: I don't think this likely to
happen. The stable-rt maintainers are happy to get rid of the older
releases as it gets harder over time to keep it alive. That's why we
stop maintaining the -rt variant as soon the matching stable branch hits
EOL.

With my SUSE hat on: we maintain our own version of rt on top of our
SLES kernel. Our v4.4 based kernels (which has significant changes
compared to the upstream stable v4.4 tree) have entered the long time
support period (LTTS). So I fear there is little interest from our side
to keep the upstream v4.4-rt branch alive. Obviously, the CIP project
could talk to our business people :)
