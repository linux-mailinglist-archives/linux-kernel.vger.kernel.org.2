I didn't get through that yet, but I have rebased the patches that
were pending in for-next onto v5.15-rc1 (no conflicts) and
smoke-tested that a sh4 build runs in my qemu environment. linux-next
pulled them 27 hours ago and hasn't complained yet either.

I started going through the list/patch backlog, but didn't make it
nearly as far as I'd like yet. If you have even a vague list of what's
important (warnings breaking the build, unapplied changes blocking
removal of cruft from other parts of the kernel and making people
unhappy with us, etc.) that would be really helpful.

I'll follow up again soon.
