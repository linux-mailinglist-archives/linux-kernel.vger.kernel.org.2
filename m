Subject: [PATCH V3 0/5] Add PMIC DT files for sc7280
Date:   Wed, 14 Apr 2021 14:04:21 +0530
Message-Id: <1618389266-5990-1-git-send-email-skakit@codeaurora.org>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.7.4
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Add PM7325 DT file with gpio and temp-alarm nodes.
For PM8350C, PMR735A and PMK8350 add the required peripherals
as the base DT files are already added [1].
[1] https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/project/lkml/list/?series=489011&state=%2A&archive=both

Changes in V2:
 - As per Matthias comments:
   - I've Split the patch into per-PMIC patches and one sc7280 patch
   - Removed 2nd critical point, thermal-governer property
   - s/pm8325_tz/pm7325_temp_alarm and s/pm7325_temp_alarm/pm7325_thermal
   - Fixed few other minor errors.

 - As per Bjorn's comments, replaced '_' with '-' in node names and moved
   DT files inclusion to board dts.

Changes in V3:
 - As per Matthias comments, changed commit text, modified criticl interrupt
   node name like <name>-crit for all pmics.
 - Moved pmk8350_vadc channel nodes to idp dts, as it is not guaranteed that
   a board with the pmk8350 will always have the other 3 PMICs
