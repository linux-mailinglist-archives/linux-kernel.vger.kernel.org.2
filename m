I forgot to point that out in the cover letter, but with v3 this change to
raw_spinlock_t is AFAICS no longer possible (at least with
CONFIG_SLUB_CPU_PARTIAL) because in put_cpu_partial() we now take the local_lock
and it can be called from get_partial_node() which takes the list_lock.

Hm but SLUB should never call the page allocator from under list_lock in my series?

Good. IIRC hackbench is very close to being a slab microbenchmark, so
regressions there are expected, but should not translate to notable real world
regressions.
