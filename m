Ok. I will make it clear in next commit messages.

I agree too.

The goal is to try to detect real bugs. In this instance specifically I
suggested to remove the "if (0) {...}" because it sounded like an
unused code.

If it is useful it is fine to keep.

For now I am only looking for dead code that cannot be enabled
by a configuration file or architecture. In fact, there are several
warnings that I am ignoring because they are a dead code in my
build but may not be in another.

I liked the idea to create htree_rep_invariant_check. I will be doing
that.

Thanks for the help and suggestions.
