Hi Sinthu Raja,

I have applied the following to branch ti-k3-dts-next on [1].
Thank you!

[1/4] dt-bindings: arm: ti: Add compatible for J721E SK
      commit: 2927c9a56e36788859606f445a5290bf21c9ab53
[2/4] arm64: dts: ti: Add support for J721E SK
      commit: 1bfda92a3a36c4dbd2b15a7f6660b673f4a2e475
[3/4] arm64: dts: ti: k3-j721e-sk: Add IPC sub-mailbox nodes
      commit: e910e5b6763d8b895ca1bba918a39d20e3361358
[4/4] arm64: dts: ti: k3-j721e-sk: Add DDR carveout memory nodes
      commit: f46d16cf5b43b66de030f0e3b2f20d24ba95f369


Side note:
- There are still cleanups that are in works (tsadc, cdns, etc..) - since
  these are already present and active cleanup is going on, letting it past,
  but if I do get a push back from upstream maintainers, I'd have to pull the
  series back.
- I had applied the yaml cleanup for j721e, so I had to apply based on the
  offset. Let me know if the changes are troublesome, else no action is
  needed - I have built and run it through the usual guantlet as best as I
  can.

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent up the chain during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a relevant bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.
