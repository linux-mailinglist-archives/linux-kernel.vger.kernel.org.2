Hi Ulf,

Thanks for the hints.
I'll check all of that and get back with updated patches.

As I tried to explain in the cover letter and in reply to Adrian, I saw
a freeze (BUSYD0) in test 37 during MMC_ERASE command  with 
SECURE_ERASE_ARG, when running this test just after test 36 (or any 
other write test). But maybe, as you said that's mostly a incorrect 
timeout issue.

Regards,
Yann
