so you mean move virtio_find_vqs() into virtbt_open() and del_vqs() into
virtbt_close()?

Or is there are way to set up the queues without starting them?

However I am failing to understand your initial concern, we do reset()
before del_vqs() in virtbt_remove(). Should we be doing something different
in virtbt_close() other than virtqueue_detach_unused_buf(). Why would I
keep buffers attached if they are not used.

Regards

Marcel
