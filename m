If I still believed in e320d3012d25, yes, that would look right
(but I don't have much faith in my judgement after all this).

I'd fallen in love with split_page_memcg() when you posted that
one, and was put off by your #ifdef, so got my priorities wrong
and went for the split_page_memcg().

Not confused, just pontificating from a misleading subset of the data.
I knew there's an even-more-history-than-tglx git tree somewhere, but
what I usually look back to is 2.4 trees, plus a 2.2.26 tree - but of
course that's a late 2.2, from 2004, around the same time as 2.6.3.
That tree shows a __free_pages() using atomic_dec_and_test().

But we digress...

Thanks for the link. And I'll willingly grant that your experience is
vast compared to mine. But "Drivers don't do that, in my experience"
is not a convincing reason to invalidate a way of working that the
code has gone out of its way to allow for, for over twenty years.

But you make a good point on the "Bad page" reports that would now
be generated: maybe that will change my mind later on.

Hugh
