The explanation is buried in that "can't trust the process" line.

E.g. user space isn't good about checking for failed write(2) syscalls.
So if the poison was in a user buffer passed to write(fd, buffer, count)
sending a SIGBUS would be the action if they read the poison directly,
so it seems reasonable to send the same signal if the kernel read their
poison for them.

It would avoid users that didn't check the return value merrily proceeding
as if everything was ok.
