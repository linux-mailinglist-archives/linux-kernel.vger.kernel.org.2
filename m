Subject: [PATCH] riscv: add correct as-options for assembly in modules
Date:   Mon, 12 Jul 2021 18:48:49 +0100

When trying to load modules built for riscv which include assembly
the kernel loader errors with "unexpected relocation type 'R_RISCV_ALIGN'"
due to R_RISCV_ALIGN relocations being generated by the assembler.

In commit 7a8e7da42250138 ("RISC-V: Fixes to module loading")
the fix for gcc adds -mno-relax to the command line when building
C files. However this was never applied to assembly flags, and gcc
does no pass -mno-relax to gas when presented with a .S file.

The fix (other than making gcc always pass -mno-relax to gas) is
to add -Wa,-mno-relax to gcc to make sure the as is invoked with
the right options.
