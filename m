Right. I do briefly point this out in the changelog (the bit about
"acquiring a sleepable lock if relevant"), but that doesn't do much to
clarify the helper name itself.

Funnily enough that is exactly how I named the thing in my initial draft,
but then I somehow convinced myself that tailoring the name to per-CPU
accesses would make its intent clearer.

I think you're right that "migratable()" is less confusing at the end of
the day. Oh well, so much for overthinking the naming problem :-)
