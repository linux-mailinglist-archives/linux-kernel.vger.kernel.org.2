Sure, how about this scheme then, for patches 2 and 3 in this series?
(Patch 1 will remain the same, pending your review of it.)

Since I do need to write to two extra registers, I'll need two
register_base's and two buffers to hold their data. This can be
generalized to "extra config registers" in the framework as follows:

- Add these two fields to `struct regmap_irq_chip`:

	unsigned int *extra_config_base; /* Points to array of extra regs */
	int num_extra_config_regs;	 /* = ARRAY_SIZE(array above) */

- Add this field to `struct regmap_irq_chip_data`:

	unsigned int **extra_config_buf;
  	/* Will be dynamically allocated to size of:
  	 * [chip->num_extra_config_regs][chip->num_regs]
  	 */

- Add a new function callback in `struct regmap_irq_chip`:

	int (*configure_extra_regs)(void *irq_drv_data, unsigned int
	type)

  This callback will be called at the end of regmap_irq_set_type():
  	
  	if (d->chip->configure_extra_regs)
		d->chip->configure_extra_regs();

  The callback, defined in the client driver, will specifically address
  the changes to regmap_irq_set_type() made in patches 2 and 3 of this
  series, viz. overriding how type_buf is to be handled, plus the
  populating of polarity_*_buf's (rechristened as extra_config_bufs in
  this proposed new scheme).

This new scheme thus makes v2 more generic. I thought I'd discuss this
with you before implementing it as v3 RFC. Could you please let me know
your thoughts?

Thank you.

Guru Das.
