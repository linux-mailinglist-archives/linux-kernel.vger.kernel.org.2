I booted the system with "ima_policy=tcb" policy with/without my patch.
I also removed /etc/ima/ima-policy for testing these use-cases.
(so that it wouldn't override the policy generated by boot param 
"ima_policy=tcb").

I double checked the contents of the kernel policy:
#cat /sys/kernel/security/integrity/ima/policy
     dont_measure fsmagic=0x9fa0
     dont_measure fsmagic=0x62656572
     dont_measure fsmagic=0x64626720
     dont_measure fsmagic=0x1021994
     dont_measure fsmagic=0x1cd1
     dont_measure fsmagic=0x42494e4d
     dont_measure fsmagic=0x73636673
     dont_measure fsmagic=0xf97cff8c
     dont_measure fsmagic=0x43415d53
     dont_measure fsmagic=0x27e0eb
     dont_measure fsmagic=0x63677270
     dont_measure fsmagic=0x6e736673
     dont_measure fsmagic=0xde5e81e4
     measure func=MMAP_CHECK mask=MAY_EXEC
     measure func=BPRM_CHECK mask=MAY_EXEC
     measure func=FILE_CHECK mask=^MAY_READ euid=0
     measure func=FILE_CHECK mask=^MAY_READ uid=0
     measure func=MODULE_CHECK
     measure func=FIRMWARE_CHECK
     measure func=POLICY_CHECK

And then I compared the contents of the ascii_runtime_measurements with 
and without my patch.

And here are my findings:

(1) Files like systemd-udevd, x2go_sessions etc. get measured multiple
     times with the CONFIG_IMA_DISABLE_HTABLE=y.
     They only get measured once with the config "=n".

     10 668df8723f5a1f57a0afe3b50d44054d66363f3e ima-ng 
sha1:51f66e82421b93b21ad1e0a25e5efa4155c6a8e0 /lib/systemd/systemd-udevd
     10 668df8723f5a1f57a0afe3b50d44054d66363f3e ima-ng 
sha1:51f66e82421b93b21ad1e0a25e5efa4155c6a8e0 /lib/systemd/systemd-udevd

(2) There are lot more instances of /tmp/<random> measurement records
     with the CONFIG_IMA_DISABLE_HTABLE=y.
     Eg,

     10 33515851cfee4acbf24de9482ff018d33def1083 ima-ng 
sha1:da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709 /tmp/oUWCVeypLR
     10 9d1dc0e1e54ee2e16308a824fc5780bd21b38208 ima-ng 
sha1:da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709 /tmp/etX8dy7qqy
     10 8643a5543179b86c02d7e3e01e16b3bd2f8dbb9f ima-ng 
sha1:da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709 /tmp/I4zTWEuyMf
     10 56e9547a4ed39036d2e790cfad78b467aa979e32 ima-ng 
sha1:da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709 /tmp/Lh5wDm6_Ep

I believe both the observations are consistent with the expected outcome 
of the patch.

Please let me know if I should test any other scenario.

I will shortly post the v3 patch with updates to description and title 
as you suggested.

Thanks,
Tushar
