Now I think that such failure was very unlikely (w/o my patch and kmem limit).
I cannot exclude it completely, because I did not finished this review and perhaps I missed something,
but I checked most part of code and found nothing.

With my patch ("memcg: prohibit unconditional exceeding the limit of dying tasks") try_charge_memcg() can fail:
a) due to fatal signal
b) when mem_cgroup_oom -> mem_cgroup_out_of_memory -> out_of_memory() returns false (when select_bad_process() found nothing)

To handle a) we can follow to your suggestion and skip excution of out_of_memory() in pagefault_out_of memory()
To handle b) we can go to retry: if mem_cgroup_oom() return OOM_FAILED.

However all these cases can be successfully handled by my new patch
"memcg: prevent false global OOM triggered by memcg limited task"
and I think it is better solution.

Thank you,
