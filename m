OK, my concern is based on the current implementation, so in that case
you can add some additional verification. That is good.

I would like to keep verifying in writer side then we can ensure the
data on ring buffer (of perf and of ftrace) is sane. If you add the unsafe
flag, you have to change all the code which access the ring buffer, not only
the filter but also eprobes, histograms, perf-tools, and other user-space
tracing tools which reads the tracing buffer directly.

I recommend you to start verifying the writer side, it should make the
change as small as possible. Unsafe flag idea may involve many other
tools. And it is not fundamentary required for user-events.

Thank you,
