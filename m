Also look at the recommended usage of 'We, I' while at it.

It makes sense to some extent, but in fact you are curing the symptom.

The root cause is that all of this is semantically ill defined.

The underlying problem is get_nohz_timer_target() which is a completely
broken heuristics trying to predict which CPU is the proper target for
handling the timer some unspecified time in the future.

In hindsight I regret that I even helped to merge that, but hindsight.
Is get_nohz_timer_target() anything near correct for some unspecified
reason? You surely know that it's not.

In fact your patch makes it even more semantically undefined simply
because it is solving the single RT thread per CPU use case which is
exposed by cyclictest. Is that universaly true for all RT tasks and use
cases?

The wild west of anything which scratches 'my itch' based on 'my use
case numbers' in Linux ended many years ago and while RT was always a
valuable playground for unthinkable ideas we definitely tried hard not
to accept use case specific hacks wihtout a proper justification that it
makes sense in general.

So why are you even trying to sell this to me?

get_nohz_timer_target() is broken by definition and while it made some
sense years ago despite it's heuristic nature, this is something which
really needs to be cleaned up because it causes more trouble than it
solves. Tagging every other timer as pinned just to work around that
underlying nonsense is just wrong.

We have been working on getting rid of this at least for the timer list
timers (which are admittedly the easier part of the problem) on and off
for years. I can't find the public links right now, but I'll ask
Anna-Maria to fill the void. Might take a while as she's AFK for a
while.

Thanks,
