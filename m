Honestly this makes me somewhat nervous. It is just a band aid for a fact
that waker detection is unreliable? There's nothing which prevents
non-shared queue to submit high amounts of IO (e.g. when it uses AIO) as
well as there's nothing which says that shared queues have no wakers (e.g.
jbd2 thread can easily be a waker for a shared queue).
