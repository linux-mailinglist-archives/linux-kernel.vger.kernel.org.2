No, we shouldn't revert the patch.
I mean can you fix the issue in perf test?
Don't test ins_lat or PERF_SAMPLE_WEIGHT_STRUCT for a non-X86 platform.

Here is the timeline for the patches.

1. The commit c7444297fd3769 and other SPR patches are merged at 
2021-02-08. At that time, I don't think we have this issue. perf test 
should work well.
2. Athira Rajeev told me that Power doesn't support instruction latency. 
So I submitted a patch which create weak functions and move the ins_lat 
into X86 specific.
3. The patch (commit fbefe9c2f87f) was finally merged at 2021-02-18. We 
should observe the perf test at this time.

As my understanding, "Fixes" should log the commit where an issue starts 
to be observed. If someone tries to backport the fix later, they have an 
idea where to put it.

Thanks,
Kan
