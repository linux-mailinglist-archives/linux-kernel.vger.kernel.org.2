The DT binding (and driver) was written assuming that people wouldn't
use the individual interrupts - but I guess someone decided it was a
good idea to have a bazillion interrupt signals going to your interrupt
controller from something as simple as a UART (which is permitted by
the PL011 TRM.) It's only taken about 20 years for this to happen, so
I think we should think we're lucky this hasn't come up before! :D

There's no difference there.

First, the "private" used with request_irq() only has to be globally
unique for the interrupt number being requested. Secondly, there is
no way for two UARTs to share the same "uap" structure, and finally
there is a 1:1 model between "uap" and "dev". So, I don't see a problem
as far as whether we use "uap" or "dev" here.

Yes. This would also make a total nonsense of using multiple interrupt
lines.

The whole point of using multiple interrupt lines from the UART is so
the interrupt demultiplexing can be handled at the interrupt controller
and their priorities can be decided there. If we adopt a software
structure where we effectively register our "merged" interrupt handler
for all these signals, then there is absolutely no benefit to using
multiple interrupt signals, since that will override any priority, and
we will still have the extra overhead of decoding which interrupt fired
at the UART level.
