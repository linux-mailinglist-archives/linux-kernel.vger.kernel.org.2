What do you mean by that? The original code never worked with what you
are suggesting. There is nothing to fix in terms of "fix". What you
are proposing is a feature. And as we know the features are going into
the kernel in a natural order, means fixes - priority 1, cleanups /
refactoring as prerequisites to the feature enabling - priority 2,
feature - priority 3, other cleanups and code improvements - priority
4.

That said, the proposed change definitely falls into category 2. It
makes the proposed feature to be easily realized.

Also, do not forget that vendor specific stuff is _by definition_
vendor specific, and the proposed feature is doubtful until you prove
there is another vendor-id pair.
