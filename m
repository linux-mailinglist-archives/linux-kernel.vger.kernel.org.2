I do not think this is a bug in clang, gcc warns the same (just not here
in this case): https://godbolt.org/z/e9GWobMnd

DRAM_DEV_SEL_0 and DRAM_DEV_SEL_1 are implicitly signed integers because
there is no suffix on the literal 1. DRAM_DEV_SEL_0 is 2 << 30, which
can be turned into 1 << 31. That is equal to INT_MAX + 1, which then
overflows and becomes INT_MIN (undefined behavior). INT_MIN is then
promoted to unsigned long because EMC_ZQ_CAL_LONG and EMC_ZQ_CAL_CMD are
unsigned long due to the BIT macro, resulting in the gigantic number
that clang reports above.

I assume that this driver only runs on hardware where unsigned int is
the same size as unsigned long, meaning this problem is merely
theoretical?

Regardless, defining DRAM_DEV_SEL_{0,1} with the BIT macro fixes the
warning for me and should make everything work as expected.
