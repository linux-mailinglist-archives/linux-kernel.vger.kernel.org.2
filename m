As Kuogee mentioned, IRQ_HPD is a message received from the panel and is 
not like your typical HW generated IRQ. There is no guarantee that we 
will not receive an IRQ_HPD until we are finished with processing of an 
earlier HPD message or an IRQ_HPD message. For example - when you run 
the protocol compliance, when we get a HPD from the sink, we are 
expected to start reading DPCD, EDID and proceed with link training. As 
soon as link training is finished (which is marked by a specific DPCD 
register write), the sink is going to issue an IRQ_HPD. At this point, 
we may not done with processing the HPD high as after link training we 
would typically notify the user mode of the newly connected display, 
etc.
