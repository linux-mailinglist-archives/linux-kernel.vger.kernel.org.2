Hi! Thanks for your reply.

I skimmed through kernel code and I didn't find any code
examples, except ext4, where kthread is freeing something. Maybe, this
API isn't required, but, as Vegard said, comment over
kthread_stop() should be changed, because it's confusing.

I have already added kthread.c developers (I hope, I chose
the right emails) to CC. Maybe, they will think about this API.

Good point, I'll add this and -ENOMEM checks and will send v2.

Thanks!
