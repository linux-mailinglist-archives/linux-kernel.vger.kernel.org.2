In this case mem_cgroup_out_of_memory() takes locks and mutexes but doing nothing
useful and its success causes try_charge_memcg() to repeat the loop unnecessarily.

I cannot change mem_cgroup_out_of_memory internals, because it is used in other places too.The check inside mem_cgroup_out_of_memory is required because situation can be changed after
check added into mem_cgroup_oom().

Though I got your argument, and will think how to improve the patch.
Anyway we'll need to do something with name of should_force_charge() function
that will NOT lead to forced charge.
