So I looked at logic_iomem.c which seems to be useful for emulated IO 
for virtio drivers
but our usecase just needs to log the mmio operations and no additional 
stuff, similar to
the logging access of x86 msr registers via tracepoint 
(arch/x86/include/asm/msr-trace.h).
Also raw read/write macros in logic_iomem.c have the callbacks which 
seems to be pretty costly
than inlining or direct function call given it has to be called for 
every register read and write
which are going to be thousands in our case. In their usecase, read and 
write callbacks are just
pci cfgspace reads and writes which may not be that frequently called 
and the latency might not
be visible but in our case, I think it would be visible if we have a 
callback as such. I know this is a
debug feature and perf isn't expected much but that wouldn't mean we 
should not have a debug
feature which performs better right.

On the second point, filtering by ioremap isn't much useful for our 
usecase since ioremapped
region can have 100s of registers and we are interested in the exact 
register read/write which
would cause any of the issues mentioned in the description of this patchset.

So I feel like the current way where we consolidate the instrumentation 
in mmio-instrumented.h
seems like the better way than adding tracing to an emulated iomem library.

Thanks,
Sai
