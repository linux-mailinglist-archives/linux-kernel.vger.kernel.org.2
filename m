Hi Adrain,


Thanks for your advice.

Our purpose is only to improve the performance of 4K reads, and we
hope that it doesn't affect any other use cases. If we look into the
latencies, it may affect not only 4K reads but also some other use
cases.

Behaviors of ASPM is controlled by circuits of hardware. Drivers only
enable or disable ASPM or set some parameters for ASPM, and are not
able to know when the device enters or exits the L0s/L1 state. So the
PM part of drivers may not suit this case.

This patch could be simply divided into two parts:
1. Monitor requests.
2. Set a vendor specific register of GL9763e.

The part 2 is no problems we think. And Ulf thinks that the behaviors
of part 1 should not be implemented in sdhci-pci-gli.c. Do you have
any suggestions on where we can implement the monitoring?

Thank you.


Best regards,

Renius
