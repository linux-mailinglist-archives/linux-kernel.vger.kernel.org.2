At initial boot, yes, device could take longer to boot.

If we were to force caller to use an interval in the order of 
milliseconds, I'd
still be using fsleep() internally anyway and just multiply the value by 
1000
before passing it on as there's a need to check if the value is greater 
than 20ms
or not.

I don't wish to reinvent the wheel and implement what we already have in 
fsleep()
internally for msec.

It would be recommended that the caller specifies an interval of at 
least 20+
msec but I don't think we can enforce that.

A point in favor of using microseconds is, if we were to expand usage of 
this
API in the future for panic path to do a busywait, we wouldn't have to 
change
the parameters.

3 options:
1. Use msec granularity and implement a partial fsleep for msec within 
the new
API.
2. Use fsleep and leave it as usec granularity.
3. Leave it at usec, and add a busywait boolean allowing caller to 
choose between
udelay() and fsleep() to also allow usage of this API in panic path (for 
patch #3).

I like options 2 and 3. Hemant/Mani, your guidance is welcome.

Thanks,
Bhaumik
