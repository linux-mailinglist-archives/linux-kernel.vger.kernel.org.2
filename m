Thanks for the heads up. Do you have a config file I can use to
reproduce this? The QEMU invocation runes would certainly help too.

It strikes me that in drivers/irqchip/irq-mips-cpu.c,
plat_irq_dispatch() now uses the irqdomain resolution before
irq_enter() took place. That's certainly a latent bug. I'll fix that
regardless, but I'd like to make sure this is what you are seeing too.

Thanks,

	M.
