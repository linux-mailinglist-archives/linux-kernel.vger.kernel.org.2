Thanks for the reply. I am not sure I understand. I could not find any 
interrupt disabling in owl_uart_remove. Could you point out where/how is 
the interrupt line is disabled before releasing the port?

A related question question was asked in

This race warning was found by a static analysis tool. The code changes 
are untested.
