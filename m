Maybe, but you do need device information in there, since that's how the
fault is reported to the guest and how the response is routed back to the
faulting device (only PASID+PRGI would cause aliasing). And we need to
report non-recoverable faults, as well as recoverable ones without PASID,
once we hand control of level-1 page tables to guests.

Moving all IOMMU controls to /dev/ioasid rather that splitting them is
probably better. Hopefully the implementation can reuse most of
vfio_iommu_type1.

I'm trying to sketch what may work for Arm, if we have to reuse
/dev/ioasid to avoid duplication of fault and inval queues:

* Get a container handle out of /dev/ioasid (or /dev/iommu, really.)
  No operation available since we don't know what the device and IOMMU
  capabilities are.

* Attach the handle to a VF. With VFIO that would be
  VFIO_GROUP_SET_CONTAINER. That causes the kernel to associate an IOMMU
  with the handle, and decide which operations are available.

* With a map/unmap vIOMMU (or shadow mappings), a single translation level
  is supported. With a nesting vIOMMU, we're populating the level-2
  translation (some day maybe by binding the KVM page tables, but
  currently with map/unmap ioctl).

  Single-level translation needs single VF per container. Two level would
  allow sharing stage-2 between multiple VFs, though it's a pain to define
  and implement.

* Without a vIOMMU or if the vIOMMU starts in bypass, populate the
  container page tables.

Start the guest.

* With a map/unmap vIOMMU, guest creates mappings, userspace populates the
  page tables with map/unmap ioctl.

  It would be possible to add a PASID mode there: guest requests an
  address space with a specific PASID, userspace derives an IOASID handle
  from the container handle and populate that address space with map/unmap
  ioctl. That would enable PASID on sub-VF assignment, which requires the
  host to control which PASID is programmed into the VF (with
  DEVICE_ALLOW_IOASID, I guess). And either the host allocates the PASID
  in this case (which isn't supported by a vSMMU) or we have to do a
  vPASID -> pPASID. I don't know if it's worth the effort.

Or
* With a nesting vIOMMU, the guest attaches a PASID table to a VF,
  userspace issues a SET_PASID_TABLE ioctl on the container handle. If
  we support multiple VFs per container, we first need to derive a child
  container from the main one and the device, then attach the PASID table.

  Guest programs the PASID table, sends invalidations when removing
  mappings which are relayed to the host on the child container. Page
  faults and response queue would be per container, so if multiple VF per
  container, we could have one queue for the parent (level-2 faults) and
  one for each child (level-1 faults).

Thanks,
Jean
