You are quite correct, apologies for my early morning confusion!

Would the block comment added by the below patch have helped?

One question for Peter...  Does each and every context switch imply a
full barrier?

I am pretty sure that it does, but figured that this was a good time
to double-check, given that RCU Tasks Trace assumes this.  ;-)

    rcu-tasks: Add block comment laying out RCU Tasks Trace design
    
    This commit adds a block comment that gives a high-level overview of
    how RCU tasks trace grace periods progress.  It also adds a note about
    how exiting tasks are handles, plus it gives an overview of the memory
    ordering.

+//	Initialize state and attempt to identify an immediate quiescent

+//	tasks that are in the process of exiting.

+//	Scans the holdout list, attempting to identify a quiescent state
+//	for each task on the list.  If there is a quiescent state, the
+//	corresponding task is removed from the holdout list.
+// rcu_tasks_trace_postgp():
+//	Wait for the count of readers do drop to zero, reporting any stalls.
+//	Also execute full memory barriers to maintain ordering with code
