Is this a 'standard' eDP connector? AFAICT, there does seem to be 
such a thing. I've said in the past I'd be okay with a edp-connector 
node. If that needs just the "HPD absent delay" property, I think that 
would be okay. It's just a never ending stream of new properties with 
each new panel that I don't want to see.
