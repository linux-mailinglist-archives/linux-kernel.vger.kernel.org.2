Ah, nice:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/secure.txt

If I understand this correctly, if optee reserves a JR it will set the
secure-status to okay and status to disabled. (There is still a missing
link, how u-boot will then be passed this modified device tree, I might
miss something here.)

But what about the HAB, if I understand Andrey correct, then JR0 will
already be marked as "S world only" (or at least no EL3 program will
release it again). To me it looks like then either JR0 should be
(1) hardcoded to secure-status = "okay", status = "disabled", or (2)
u-boot SPL (or TF-A) should return it to NS world (and optee might
take it over again).
