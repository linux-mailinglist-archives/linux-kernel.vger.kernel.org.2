We wanted to  first understand the requirement of bounded deferred probe 
why it was really required.

~600ms (deferred probe bound to little core) and ~200ms (deferred probe 
queued on unbound wq).

Yes, we are exploring in that direction as well but want to get upstream 
opinion and understand the usability of unbounded wq.

While debugging further and checking if probe are migrating found that 
init thread can potentially migrate, as it has cpu affinity set to all 
cpus, during driver probe (or there is something which prevents it, 
which I am missing?) . Also, async probes use unbounded workqueue.
So, using unbounded wq for deferred probes looks to be similar to these, 
w.r.t. scheduling behavior.
