It's a nonsense fiction until it's not, at which point it will bite
you in the arse.

Well, "iommu" group might not be the best name, but hardware isolation
is still a real concern here, even if it's not entirely related to the
IOMMU.

Really?  So what do you do when you discover some mdevs you thought
were isolated actually aren't due to a hardware bug?  Drop support
=66rom the driver entirely?  In which case what do you say to the people
who understandably complain "but... we had all the mdevs in one guest
anyway, we don't care if they're not isolated"?

Ok.

Didn't it?  Seems to me the admin that in order to give the group to
DPDK, the admin had to find and unbind all the things in it... so is
therefore aware that they're giving everything in it to DPDK.

Well, I guess, if you take the view that root is allowed to break the
kernel.  I tend to prefer that although root can obviously break the
kernel if they intend do, we should make it hard to do by accident -
which in this case would mean the kernel *enforcing* that the devices
in the group have the same security labels, which I can't really see
how to do without an exposed group.
