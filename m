Much better, thanks.

But, I have a few questions here:

Why do you have to manually add/remove these groups still?

A huge hint that something is going wrong is when you have to call a
sysfs_*() call from within a driver.  There should be proper driver_*()
calls for you instead to get the job done.

As this is a platform device, why not set the dev_groups variable in the
platform_driver field so that these attribute groups get added and
removed automatically?

An example commit to look at that shows how this was converted for one
driver is 5bd08a4ae3d0 ("platform: x86: hp-wmi: convert platform driver
to use dev_groups").  See if that helps here as well.

thanks,

greg k-h
