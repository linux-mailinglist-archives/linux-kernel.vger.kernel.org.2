Accepting a half arsed CFI now, just because it is what we have, will
only make it ever so much more difficuly to get new/better
things implemented in the toolchains, because the pressure is off.

Also, it will make enabling IBT more difficult, or we'll end up having
CFI and IBT mutually exclusive, which is a crap position to be in.

It works by accident, not design. Which is a giant red flag in my book.

I don't want to evolve from a place that's crazy and we shouldn't have
been in to begin with. Redefining what a function pointer is is insane,
and the required work-arounds are ugly at best.

The ARM64 folks have expressed regret from having merged it. Why should
x86 do something that's known to cause regret?

See above. Maybe some of those folks will get motivated to make it
happen faster.

By sodding accident; see that one static call patch that makes it burn.

If someone were to use the jump-table entry after we'd scribbled it,
thing will go sideways bad.

Clearly we disagree.

It's only needed for the 'legacy' case of software only CFI if that
makes you feel better. BTI/IBT based CFI doesn't need this.

(also, I'm very much a bare metal kinda guy)

IBT case ^ doesn't actually read from the code. It simply jumps in front
of the real function by a set amount to get the extra cruft /
landing-pad required for indirect calls.

Also note that direct calls never make use of that pad, which means it
can be stripped from all symbols that never have their address taken,
which means less indirect targets.

(Or poison the thing with UD2 and write 0 in the immediate)

The strong suggestion is that function pointers are sane, and there's a
few other considerations, but yes.

Somewhat hard, it's much easier to find a single instruction than a
pattern. Also, footprint. Smaller really is better.

As stated above, we're in violent disagreement that the proposed scheme
comes anywhere near good. I utterly hate the redefintion of function
pointers and I also think the range compare goes sideways in the face of
modules. That's two marks against jump-tables.

(Also, in the !CFI case, you can't actually free the jump-tables, since
you're uncondtionally s(t)uck with them because of how &func is
wrecked.)
