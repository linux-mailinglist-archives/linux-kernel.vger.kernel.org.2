Yes, thank you!

(after this interaction, I'll fix and improve all this description,
according to your comments)

By definition of waker, the purpose of Q1's I/O is doing what needs to
be done, so that new Q2's I/O can finally be issued.  Delaying Q2's I/O
is the opposite of this goal.

And I agree too, if the drive has no internal queueing, has no
parallelism or pipeline, or is at least one order of magnitude slower
than the CPU is processing I/O.  In all other cases, serving the I/O
of only one queue at a time means throwing away throughput.  For
example, on a consumer SSD, moving from one to two I/O threads served
in parallel usually means doubling the throughput.

So, the best thing to do, if all the above conditions are met, is to
have this new I/O dispatched as soon as possible.

The most efficient way to attain this goal is to just put the new I/O
directly into the dispatch list.

Yeah, the goal here is to reduce a little bit false positives.

Yes, hopefully experience will lead us to even improvements or even
better solutions.
