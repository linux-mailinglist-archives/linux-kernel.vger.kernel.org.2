HOLD ON :-)

I recalled why I added this patch to this patch set. I had a reason for
it.

It's because of the NUMA patch. I have duplicate all the NUMA changes
here if I don't refactor this somewhat redundant code out.

So, if I add a note about this to the commit message? IMHO, this is good
enough reason to carry the patch.
