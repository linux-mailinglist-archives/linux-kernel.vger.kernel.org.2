Not exactly, this issue is not specific to camera. If you look at
the numbers in the commit text, even for the test device its the
same observation. It depends on the buffer size we are unmapping
which affects the number of TLBIs issue. I am not aware of any
such HW side bw issues for camera specifically on QCOM devices.

Thanks,
