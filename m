From the documentation, there are a couple of big questions and a bunch of word smithing.

pseudo-bus : do we need a bus ?

xrt-lib real platform devices that aren't fpga, do they need to move to another subsystem ?

Overall looks good, love the ascii art!

A pseudo-bus.

It would be good if this was close to what was done for dfl here

subsystem drivers

drivers in fpga/ should be for managing just the fpganess of the fpga.

soft devices ex/ a soft tty should go to their respective subsystem location

Are there any in this patchset you think might move ?

Maybe we can defer reviewing those now.

core infrastructure.

The interfaces to the infrastructure are not in include/linux/fpga/

Maybe this needs to change.

The connection of a 'group' node to a fpga region region is fairly important, maybe move this section earlier. 'group' as an fpganess thing would be kept in fpga/ subsystem.

Maybe a split is pseudo device leaves, those without real IO mem, stay in fpga/  others go ?
