"-foo-" does not work as emphasis in ReST markdown.
Use "*foo*" instead.

Signed-off-by: Akira Yokosawa <akiyks@gmail.com>

Hi Paul,

This is relative to -rcu's dev branch.
I've started learning how to do ReST markdown. ;-)

For emphasis, both "*foo*" and "_bar_" work.
I see several "*foo*" patterns in other .rst files under RCU/.

Yes, I have now sphinx installed in a container for "make htmldocs" to work.
"make pdfdocs" does not work as expected at the moment, though.

        Thanks, Akira
