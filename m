Subject: [PATCH tip/core/rcu 17/19] rcu: Improve comments describing RCU read-side critical sections
Date:   Tue, 11 May 2021 15:53:02 -0700

There are a number of places that call out the fact that preempt-disable
regions of code now act as RCU read-side critical sections, where
preempt-disable regions of code include irq-disable regions of code,
bh-disable regions of code, hardirq handlers, and NMI handlers.  However,
someone relying solely on (for example) the call_rcu() header comment
might well have no idea that preempt-disable regions of code have RCU
semantics.

This commit therefore updates the header comments for
call_rcu(), synchronize_rcu(), rcu_dereference_bh_check(), and
rcu_dereference_sched_check() to call out these new(ish) forms of RCU
readers.
