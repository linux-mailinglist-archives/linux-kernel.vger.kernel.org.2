In one of the earlier discussions, I was made aware of some use cases (by
AMD, iirc) where PASID can be used w/o IOMMU. That is why I tried to keep
ioasid a separate subsystem. Other than that, I don't see an issue
combining the two.

I totally agree in terms of generality. I was just trying to point out
existing framework or drivers such as uacce and idxd driver does not have a
need to use /dev/ioasid.

it matters when it comes to which interface to choose. Use /dev/ioasid to
allocate if PASID value cannot be hidden. Use some other interface for bind
current and allocate if a PASID is not visible to the user.

Yes, I think we are on the same page. For example, today's uacce or idxd
driver creates a hidden PASID when user does open(), where a new WQ is
provisioned and bound to current mm. This is the case where /dev/ioasid is
not needed.

Sorry, I am not following. In the doc, I have an example to show the
ioasid_set to VM/mm mapping. We use mm as the ioasid_set token to identify
who the owner of an IOASID is. i.e. who allocated the IOASID. Non-owner
cannot perform bind page table or free operations.

Yes, each PF/VF has its own PASID table. The device can do whatever
it wants as long as the PASID is present in the table. Programming of the
pIOMMU PASID table entry, however, is controlled by the host.

IMHO, there are two levels of security here:
1. A PASID can only be used by a secure context
2. A device can only use allowed PASIDs (PASID namespace is system-wide but
PASID table storage is per PF/VF)

IOASID set is designed for #1.

If two mdevs from the same PF dev are assigned to two VMs, the PASID
table will be shared. IOASID set ensures one VM cannot program another VM's
PASIDs. I assume 'secure context' is per VM when it comes to host PASID.

No. the mdev driver consults with IOASID core When the guest programs a
guest PASID on to he mdev. VDCM driver does a lookup:
host_pasid = ioasid_find_by_spid(ioasid_set, guest_pasid);

If the guest_pasid does not exist in the ioasid_set, the mdev programming
fails; if the guest_pasid does exist but it maps to a wrong host PASID, the
damage is limited to the guest itself.

I guess that is not the case. For VT-d dedicated WQ, there is only one
PASID can be programmed onto the device. Programming the PASID with
/dev/sva FD abc command will be checked against its mm where /dev/ioasid is
used to do the allocation.

For a single shared WQ assigned to multiple VMs, there will be one mdev per
VM. Again, FD commands is limited to the PASIDs allocated for the VM.

For a single share WQ assigned to one VM, it can be bound to multiple guest
processes/PASIDs. Host IOMMU driver maintains a list of the PASIDs and
ensures that they are only programmed on to the per device PASID table.

I agree, I don't think this is the case. The ioasid_set is some what
orthogonal to mdev collections.

Could you expand on that? Guaranteeing quota is very difficult. cgroup
limit model fits most scalar resources.

You mean a single /dev/ioasid FD per VM and KVM? I think that is what we
are doing in this set. A VM process can only open /dev/ioasid once, then
use the FD for allocation and pass the PASID for bind page table etc.

I think we are on the same page. For mdev, VDCM driver makes sure the guest
PASID programmed is allocated by the same VM that also performed the bind SVA.

For PF/VF which is not mediated, the permission is implied by the IOMMU
driver/HW since PASID table is per device.

We have G-H PASID translation. They don't have to be 1:1.
IOASID Set Private ID (SPID) is intended as a generic solution for guest PASID.
Could you review the secion Section: IOASID Set Private ID (SPID) in the
doc patch?

We also had some slides from last year. Slide 3s-6 mostly.
