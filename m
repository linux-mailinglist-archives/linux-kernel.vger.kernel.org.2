You're welcome.  I would actually prefer to see it as reported by
kernelci.org since I wouldn't have found it without the automated
testing and bisection.  If you're OK to change this trailer:

  Reported-by: "kernelci.org bot" <bot@kernelci.org>

Sure. https://lava.collabora.co.uk/scheduler/job/3249387

Thanks,
