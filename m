Few pointers from your example:

1. mhi_poll() is currently not used by any client upstream yet.
2. Polling is not to be used for single event ring (shared control + 
data) cases
since it is meant to be for client drivers with dedicated data packets 
only.
3. mhi_send_cmd() will always be called after an mhi_pm_m0_transition() 
has
completed by design since we wait for the device to be held in M0 prior 
to it.

Would like to know what Mani and Hemant have to say. I don't think we 
can run in
to the scenario from your example so we should be safe.

Thanks,
Bhaumik
