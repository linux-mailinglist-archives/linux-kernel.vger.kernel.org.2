Not sure I got your point. IRQ context never does reclaim so anything
outside of NOWAIT/ATOMIC is pointless. But you might be refering to a
future code where GFP_FS might have a meaning outside of the reclaim
context?

Anyway if we are to allow modifying PF_ flags from an interrupt contenxt
then I believe we should make that code IRQ aware at least. I do not
feel really comfortable about async modifications when this is stated to
be safe doing in a non atomic way.

But I suspect we have drifted away from the original issue. I thought
that a simple check would help us narrow down this particular case and
somebody messing up from the IRQ context didn't sound like a completely
off.
