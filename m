My dear,

I work with Nsia Bank, and the account manager to Engineer Jonas, who 
has an account valued at $16.7Million usd. He died with his wife, and 
their two children on the 21st of April 2018 in a ghastly car accident 
along Yamoussoukro express road here in Ivory Coast.

Since we've been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for two years 
now, i seek your acceptance to present you as a relative to the 
deceased, for the fund to be released to you as his next of kin which 
will be transferred to your account, and upon confirmation in your 
account it will be sheared 50%/50% between us.

All I require is your honest cooperation to receive and secure the fund 
in your account till it is sheared accordingly. It is risk free as our 
interest will be protected. If you are capable of securing the fund , 
respond to my proposition by providing your address, age, occupation and 
your mobile number.

Waiting to hear from you.
David Kone
