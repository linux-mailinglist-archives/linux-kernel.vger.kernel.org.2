Right; clearly you can do that within the container.
But my main grudge here is not the container but rather the system
_hosting_ the container.
That is typically using devtmpfs and hence will see _all_ devices, even
those belonging to the container.
This is causing grief to no end if eg the host system starts activating
LVM on devices which are passed to the qemu instance running within a
container ...

Network namespaces already have the bits and pieces to modify sysfs, so
we should be able to leverage that for block, too.
And I think by restricting it to 'block' devices we should be to keep
the required sysfs modifications in a manageable level.

Granted, modifying sysfs layout is not something for the faint-hearted,
and one really has to look closely to ensure you end up with a
consistent layout afterwards.

But let's see how things go; might well be that it turns out to be too
complex to consider. Can't tell yet.
