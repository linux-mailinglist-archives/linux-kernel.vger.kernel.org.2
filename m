Coming back to my change, a quick reminder of the latest questions and some
updated answers:

As I mentioned earlier, I am not familiar with TPM 1.2. However, to
generalize the answer, such a state, like a firmware upgrade does make
sense on TPM 1.2. From what I know it is performed using different calls
to TPM but the concept is there.

Reconsidered and implemented appropriate change. See the patch.

I never intended to relay on TPM_CHIP_FLAG_TPM2. In this case the point
to avoid calling cdev_device_add if the chip is not TPM2 or is in
firmware Upgrade/Recovery mode.

The standard doesn't specify what RC should be returned if TPM is in
Recovery mode. What the standard agrees on is that the underlying call
will fail.

The logic behind this check goes like that: Assume that if we reached
this point TPM is not in Upgrade mode. Although, it can still be in
Recovery mode. If the tpm2_get_cc_attrs_tbl() call fails, then my
assumption is that TPM requires firmware recovery.

This mode is introduced to handle situations when TPM firmware Upgrade
failed. In such a case TPM allows to flash only original firmware to bring
the functionality back. There is a predefined list of calls to which TPM
is going to answer in this mode. Responses to other calls are vendor-dependent.

Another assumption here is that if for some reason there is a communication
error occurred at this point it will be caught here. Any better ideas
on how to handle this are welcome.
