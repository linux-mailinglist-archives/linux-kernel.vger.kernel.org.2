Isn't this a bit like one of the PPC? ABI where function addresses
aren't (always) the entry point.
IIRC is causes all sorts of obscure grief.

I'd also like to know how indirect calls are actually expected to work.
The whole idea is that the potential targets might be in a kernel module
that is loaded at run time.

Scanning a list of possible targets has to be a bad design decision.

If you are trying to check that the called function has the right
prototype, stashing a hash of the prototype (or a known random number)
before the entry point would give most of the benefits without most
of the costs.
The linker could be taught to do the same test (much like name mangling
but without the crap user experience).

That scheme only has the downside of a data cache miss and (hopefully)
statically predicted correct branch (hmm - except you don't want to
speculatively execute the wrong function) and polluting the data cache
with code.

This all seems like a ploy to force people to buy faster cpus.
