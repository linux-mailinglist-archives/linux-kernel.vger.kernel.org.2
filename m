Dear Friend,

It is with trust and sincerity that I approach you for assistance to
transfer some funds into your bank account. Please accept my apology
if my mail infringes on your personal ethics. My name is Greg Osborn,
a Private attorney based here in Johannesburg, Republic of South
Africa. Honestly it will be my humble pleasure if we can work
together. I would like you to act as the next of kin to my deceased
client Mr. Glenn Warrington, a US citizen who made a deposit of
$23,500,000.00 ($23.5 Million Dollars) with a Bank here in
Johannesburg. He died in a car accident on the 20th of November 2009
without any registered next of kin. Several efforts were made to find
his extended family through their embassy without success.I have
received an official letter from the bank suggesting a likely
proceeding for confiscation of the Fund in line with existing laws by
the bank in which my client deposited the sum of $23.5 Million
Dollars. According to the Government Law here, at the expiration of 10
years the fund will revert to the ownership of the South African
Government, if nobody applies to claim the fund. My proposition to you
is to present you to the bank as the Next of kin to my late client so
that the bank will pay this $23.5 Million Dollars to you as his
beneficiary so that we can share the amount on a mutually agreed
percentage of 60% for me 40% for you.

All legal documents to back up your claim will provided by me. All I
require is your honest cooperation to enable us to see this
transaction through. I will also guarantee you that this will be
executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any
breach of the law here or in your country.

If you are interested in this transactions, Please do contact me so
that I can give you comprehensive details on how to proceed
(gregosbornlaw@gmail.com)Your immediate
response will be highly appreciated.

Regards,

Advocate Greg Osborn.
