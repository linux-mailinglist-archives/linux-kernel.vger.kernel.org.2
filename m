To be quite honest, some people wondered if it had gone offpath, what we 
wanted in the 90s. It hasn´t. J x is what we wanted. I can do my 
research, and people get their streaming. JPU is a theoretical joint 
processing unit, where intergration means less latency and buswork. For 
smaller size computers, with less fans, that if necessary can have a 
purplehiss noise profile. Giving an optimal sales point fair IT 
computer, with €.

SERENITY.
