I've read the whole history from Marek and Will.
As I explained to Will, we need more time to test regarding decreasing the rating of MCTv2.
Decreasing the rating is related only performance not functionality.
So from regression perspective, it's not easy to change the rating on this new driver at this time.

Thanks for pointing out and sharing "Doug Anderson"'s explanation.
As we use ARM arch timer as a clock source currently, we should get rid of it.
