Sounds good to me.

Well, usually they just don't touch buffers belonging to the committing
transation, they just store in b_next_transaction that after commit is
done, buffer should be added to the currently running transaction. There
are some exceptions though - e.g. jbd2_journal_invalidatepage() (called
from truncate code) which returns EBUSY in some rare cases and we use
jbd2_log_wait_commit() in ext4_wait_for_tail_page_commit() to wait for
commit to be done before we know it is safe to destroy the buffer.
