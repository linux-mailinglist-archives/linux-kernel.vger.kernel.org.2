Hmm I already see a lot of the options in drivers/clocksource/Kconfig
depend on HAS_IOMEM and drivers/clocksource/timer-of.c definitely calls
iounmap() so wouldn't that be the logical change even if it is bigger?

Yes because most architectures always have IOMEM and io*map() functions
I believe. s390 is an exception here as the mainframe native
functionality all works without MMIO and you can run a fully functional
system including networking and block devices without any MMIO, PCI and
without ioremap()/iounmap().

Ideally not a compile time error but a compile time flag such as a
Kconfig option that would make sure that if HAS_IOMEM isn't set we
don't get drivers compiled which depend on working io*map(). After all
these drivers will surely not be functional.
