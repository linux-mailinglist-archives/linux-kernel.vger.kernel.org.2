I'd like Andreas to comment here.  My understanding is that MMP
originally intended as a safety mechanism which would be used as part
of a primary/backup high availability system, but not as the *primary*
system where you might try to have two servers simultaneously try to
mount the file system and use MMP as the "election" mechanism to
decide which server is going to be the primary system, and which would
be the backup system.

The cost of being able to handle this particular race is it would slow
down the mounts of cleanly unmounted systems.

There *are* better systems to implement leader elections[1] than using
MMP.  Most of these more efficient leader elections assume that you
have a working IP network, and so if you have a separate storage
network (including a shared SCSI bus) from your standard IP network,
then MMP is a useful failsafe in the face of a network partition of
your IP network.  The question is whether MMP should be useful for
more than that.  And if it isn't, then we should probably document
what MMP is and isn't good for, and give advice in the form of an
application note for how MMP should be used in the context of a larger
system.
