Oh well, I have one objection, returning NULL from op->next will be
passed to op->stop, and then it will not free the allocated value.

The example is elegantly avoiding this, by not returning NULL anywhere,
and also not stopping. Sigh.

Maybe not return NULL in op->next, but only from op->start, and only
when no allocation was made or it was freed already? Or free it only/
already in op->next, when returning NULL?
