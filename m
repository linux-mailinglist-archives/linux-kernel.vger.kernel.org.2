Agreed.

The auto generated ones need a lot of work to be relevant outside of
the vexriscv CPU (I tried to build for rocket, a different riscv, and
the script blew up...).

In the future it would be good to have this one support the drivers
that are merged upstream.

I should have mentioned that the driver and bindings were merged
through the network tree last week. You can see them in Friday's
linux-next.

Cheers,

Joel

Hello:

This series was applied to netdev/net-next.git (refs/heads/master):

Here is the summary with links:
  - [v4,1/2] dt-bindings: net: Add bindings for LiteETH
    https://git.kernel.org/netdev/net-next/c/b0f8d3077f8f
  - [v4,2/2] net: Add driver for LiteX's LiteETH network interface
