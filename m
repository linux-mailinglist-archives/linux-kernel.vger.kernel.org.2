That was my understanding as well, DT overlays are a "new thing" afaik
and most devices (at least all Sony's that I'm working with) use an
appended DTB that's always in-sync with the kernel image.

Sounds good, I'll leave this patch out from v2.  Should it have a Fixes:
tag to get backported too?

Since most review seems to be in I'll respin v2 shortly with the
addition of the "ref" clock to msm8974, that should probably get the
same treatment (added to 5.15 fixes) then we can land this patchset in
5.16 (maybe without .name= fallback if Dmitry is okay with that).
