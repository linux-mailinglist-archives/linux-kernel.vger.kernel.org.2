hi,
I ran the test again and there's still the slowdown,
adding the stats below

I'm doing the review and I noticed few strange things,
but so far nothing that would explain that

like I can see for 40 threads only 35 threads spawned,
need to check on that more

also I'll try run some tests for parallel_for > 1 to cut
down some of the workqueue code.. any tests on that?

jirka
