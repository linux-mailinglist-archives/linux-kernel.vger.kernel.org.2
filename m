On the Lenovo Yoga C630 this is reproduced by starting alacritty and if
I'm lucky I managed to hit a few keys before it crashes, so I spent a
few hours looking into this as well...

As you say, the dev_pm_opp_set_opp() will only cast a interconnect vote.
The opp-level is just there for show and isn't used by anything, at
least not on 845.

Further more, I'm missing something in my tree, so the interconnect
doesn't hit sync_state, and as such we're not actually scaling the
buses. So the problem is not that Linux doesn't turn on the buses in
time.

So I suspect that the "AHB bus error" isn't saying that we turned off
the bus, but rather that the GPU becomes unstable or something of that
sort.


Lastly, I reverted 9bc95570175a ("drm/msm: Devfreq tuning") and ran
Aquarium for 20 minutes without a problem. I then switched the gpu
devfreq governor to "userspace" and ran the following:

while true; do
  echo 257000000 > /sys/class/devfreq/5000000.gpu/userspace/set_freq
  echo 710000000 > /sys/class/devfreq/5000000.gpu/userspace/set_freq
done

It took 19 iterations of this loop to crash the GPU.

So the problem doesn't seem to be Rob's change, it's just that prior to
it the chance to hitting it is way lower. Question is still what it is
that we're triggering.

Bjorn
