In the ONFI specification, the sdr_timing_mode field is defined as
follow:

SDR timing mode support
BIT  VALUE MEANING
6-15 N/A   Reserved (0)
5    1     supports timing mode 5
4    1     supports timing mode 4
3    1     supports timing mode 3
2    1     supports timing mode 2
1    1     supports timing mode 1
0    1     supports timing mode 0, shall be 1

IOW sdr_timing_modes *cannot* be 0, or it is a truly deep and crazily
impacting hardware bug (so far I am not aware of any chip not returning
the right timing mode 0 value). Hence my proposal to turn best_mode as
unsigned. I honestly don't know what is the best option here and am
fully open to other suggestions to silence the robot.

Thanks,
Miqu√®l
