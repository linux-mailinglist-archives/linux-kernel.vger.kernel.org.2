 From what I know, newer ARM A-profile cores doesn't allow data tracing. 
And you
are saying that just the instruction tracing cannot be used to infer any
important data.

There are few security folks in CC who probably can give us more details 
on how
branch tracing can be used for an exploit. @mnissler?

Thanks,
