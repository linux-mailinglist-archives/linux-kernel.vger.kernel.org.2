I asked in #linux-msm whether anything is wrong with the patterns,
since my Sony Discovery (sdm630 with a pm660l) blinks way quicker on a
pattern that's supposed to stay on for 1s and off for 1s:

    echo "0 1000 255 1000" > /sys/class/leds/rgb\:status/hw_pattern

It however seems to be broken in the same way on an older version now
(this might be v9 or v8) which I don't remember to be the case.  Can you
double-check if this is all working fine on your side?  If so, I'll have
to find some time to debug it on my end.

Thanks!
