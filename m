I'm all for using .fw_name there, and I hope we all agree that clock 
dependencies based on global names should become a thing of the past; 
every such inter-driver dependency should be clearly visible in the DT. 
  We (SoMainline) can tackle this DSI side if no-one else is working on 
it yet.

Unfortunately this regresses yes, starting with:

     dsi0n1_postdiv_clk: Zero divisor and CLK_DIVIDER_ALLOW_ZERO not set

And proceeding with more such errors on different clocks, clocks getting 
stuck or failing to update, and the panel never showing anything at all.

Should we fix DSI PHYs first and let this patch sit for a while, or keep 
the implicit global "xo" clock just a little while longer until that's 
over with?

Either way, feel free to attach my:

Yes it is, both do _not_ look at clocks specified in DT before "falling 
back" to global names (that only happens when both .name and .fw_name 
are specified).  I'm sort of expressing the desire for .parent_fw_names 
here in hopes of phasing out global clock names on DT platforms 
altogether.  We definitely shouldn't rework .parent_names to support 
both, that only causes confusion and an implicit fallback to global 
clocks when the DT is under-specifying the required clocks is exactly 
what we're trying to avoid.

Fair, if done at all it should end up in a separate (2/2) patch or I'll 
take care of this in a followup.
