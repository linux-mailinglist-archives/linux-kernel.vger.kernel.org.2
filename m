1) irq_hpd interrupt always happen before unplug interrupt
2)if hdp_isr_status = (DP_DP_IRQ_HPD_INT_MASK | 
DP_DP_HPD_UNPLUG_INT_MASK) at the time when read at 
dp_display_irq_handler(),
then DP_DP_IRQ_HPD_INT_MASK will be add into evetn q first followed by 
DP_DP_HPD_UNPLUG_INT_MASK be add into event q.
So that DP_DP_IRQ_HPD_INT_MASK will be executed by the event thread 
before DP_DP_HPD_UNPLUG_INT_MASK.
On the other word, IRQ_HPD has higher priority over UNPLUG in the timing 
matter.
By doing that we can shut down display gracefully.

If you insist, at hdp_isr_status = (DP_DP_IRQ_HPD_INT_MASK | 
DP_DP_HPD_UNPLUG_INT_MASK) case,
we can have only add DP_DP_HPD_UNPLUG_INT_MASK to event q only by 
dropping DP_DP_IRQ_HPD_INT_MASK.
Is this will work for you?
