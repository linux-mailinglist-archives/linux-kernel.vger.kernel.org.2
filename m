While this is probably mostly an issue for console drivers, the problem
is more general and we'd need to identify and add workarounds for any
lock that could be taken by a second interrupt handler.

I was hoping you'd say that. :) Just wasn't sure whether it would
cripple threadirqs too much.

Looks good to me. Do you want to spin that into a patch or shall I do
it after some testing?
