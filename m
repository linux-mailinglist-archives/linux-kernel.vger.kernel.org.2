Please explain that further. Why do we need the mmap lock to insert PMDs 
but not when insert PTEs?

I don't think so. We could just align all buffers to their next power of 
two in size. Since we have plenty of offset space that shouldn't matter 
much.

Apart from that I still don't fully get why we need this in the first place.

I don't think so either. See with don't need any extra effort for the 
alignment nor the handling, it actually becomes much cheaper as far as I 
can see.

In other words when you have a fault you don't care about the faulting 
address that much, you only use it to determine the memory segment to map.

Then this whole memory segment is mapped into the address space of the 
user application.

If can of course happen that we need to fiddle with addresses and sizes 
because userspace only mmap a fraction of the underlying buffer, but in 
reality we never do this.

I really don't see that either. When a buffer is accessed by the CPU it 
is in > 90% of all cases completely accessed. Not faulting in full 
ranges is just optimizing for a really unlikely case here.

Well for quick fixing this I would rather disable huge pages for now.
