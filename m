This used to be a DT attribute in PATCHv1. It has been moved over to
sysfs since PATCHv2, since it does not describe the hardware, but
configuration. Unfortunately lore.kernel.org does not have the full
thread, but this is the discussion:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-serial/20170629182618.jpahpmuq364ldcv2@pengut=
ronix.de/

=46rom downstream POV this can be done either by adding a DT property
to the UART node, or by adding a udev rule.

=46rom my POV there is not a huge difference. In both cases we will
be bound by an ABI afterwards, in both cases people will usually
stick to the default value and in both cases people that do deviate
=66rom the default probably ran into problems and started to look
for a solution.

Thanks,

-- Sebastian
