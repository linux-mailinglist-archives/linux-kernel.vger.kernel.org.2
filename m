Yeah, this is not what is traditionally called branch folding (which
stores the instruction being branched to in some cache, originally the
instruction cache itself; somewhat similar (but different) to the BTIC
on 750).  Overloaded terminology :-)

6xx/7xx CPUs had the branch execution unit in the frontend, and it would
not issue a branch at all if it could be resolved then already.  Power4
and later predict all branches, and most are not issued at all (those
that do need to be executed, like bdnz, are).  At completion time it is
checked if the prediction was correct (and corrective action is taken if
not).
