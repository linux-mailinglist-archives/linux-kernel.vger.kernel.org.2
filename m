I think Rob's suggestion of just moving the elf_load_addr,
elf_headers_sz fields (and for consistency, elf_headers as well even though it
isn't used in tihs file) from kimage_arch to kimage.

The downside is that these fields will go unused on a number of
architectures, but it's not worth complicating the code just because of
it.

The patch to do that would have to go before "of: Add a common kexec FDT
setup function". That should be enough to preserve bisectability for all arches.
