Subject: [PATCH 1/2] docs: Make syscalls' helpers naming consistent

The documentation explains the need to create internal syscalls' helpers,
and that they should be called `kern_xyzzy()`. However, the comment at
include/linux/syscall.h says that they should be named as
`ksys_xyzzy()`, and so are all the helpers declared bellow it. Change the
documentation to reflect this.

 useful to be used within the kernel, needs to be shared between an old and a
 new syscall, or needs to be shared between a syscall and its compatibility
