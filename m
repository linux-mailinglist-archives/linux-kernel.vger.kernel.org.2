After a discussion on this topic, we chose to pursue option B, as enabling this
regulator fixes a very bad regression. Splitting the power-controller nodes does
require a bit of time due to some more research that has to be done on that topic.

Adrian will follow with a v2 of this patch, adding a Fixes tag.

Thanks everyone,
