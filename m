That analogy's purpose was to put over my point that writing
(paraphrased) "Since non-RT changed, this workaround isn't necessary any
more" suggests to me that the change might be bad for RT. So again,
there was no harm intended, this is just a call for clearing up either
the commit log to make it obvious the change is right or to fix the
problem on RT if there is any.

The code in question was used for both RT and non-RT. You drop it for
both cases and only justify one of them. OK, fine, you considered both
cases. Just from reading the commit log I considered you didn't. It's
completely ok for me to be wrong here, but I still think the chosen
words are not optimal and stumbling as I did is easy. So I still see a
potential to improve the wording.

Best regards
Uwe
