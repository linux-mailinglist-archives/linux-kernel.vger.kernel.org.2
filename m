Dear Beneficiary,

UNITED NATION, and PAYMENT NOTIFICATION this is to bring to your
notice that, I have paid the re-activation fee and the delivery of
your ATM Card. I paid it because the ATM Card is 8119
(US$4.800,000.00), has less three days to expire and when it expires,
the money will go into Government purse. With that I decided to help
you pay the money so that, the ATM Card will not expire, because I
know when you will get your ATM Card definitely you must pay me back
my money and even compensate me for helping you.

Now i want you to contact DHL COURIER SERVICE with your Full Contact
information?s so that they can deliver your Card to your designated
address without any delay. Like I stated earlier, the delivery charges
has been paid but i did not pay their official keeping fees since they
refused. They refused and the reason is that they do not know when you
are going to contact them and demurrage might have increase.

YOU? COUNTRY; YOU? FULL NAME;
OCCUPATION; HOME ADDRESS; PASS PORT;
MOBIL PHONE NUMBER; OFFICE NUMBER;
HOME NUMBER; AGE; SEX;

Below is their Contact Information?s, Contact Person: Larry Page. DHL
