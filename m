I personally cannot commit to supporting this kernel for 6 years
(and personally do not want to backport new features to a 6 year old kernel).
And customers are finicky and ask for one thing and then change their mind later.
We'll have to see what decisions are made at a company level for this as there
are added costs to run tests on LTS kernel branches.  We already run extensive QA on
whatever active development branches are in use and a subset on the mainline
branch as well.  QA resources are finite and committing those for 6 years is
not something that makes sense if customers drop that kernel version.
Testing of the LTS kernel changes really moves out of our hands and into the
customer's testing after our major releases to them.

Other difficulty with the LTS version is the frequency it is updated.  We would not
pickup the changes that frequently to test.  A quarterly, bi-annually, or when a critical fix
is identified would be when we update and perform any meaningful testing when in maintainence.

Thanks for the link.  Will forward it to see if it helps make any commitment from customers
or company.

The link Pavel sent looks interesting.
"CIP project intends to maintain 5.10 for a long time, so you can expect testing/help from them:
https://www.cip-project.org/blog/2020/12/02/cip-to-embark-on-kernel-5-10-development-for-slts
"

If the CIP project has committed to 10 years you would think they would be in contact
with you to add their support to the 5.10 LTS effort.
