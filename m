Looking at the history, I assume this already broke with cffa4b2122f5
("regmap: debugfs: Fix a memory leak when calling regmap_attach_dev").
This is why the kernel is trying to recreate the "dummy" debugfs
directory on my system when regmap_attach_dev() is called by imx-
pinctrl.

I'm not convinced that the behaviour before that commit was strictly
better - when regmap_debugfs_init() was called for the second time, the
new debugfs paths would be created, but the old ones were never
removed, they just leaked.

Right, there are definitely cases where that's not happening - the
mentioned syscon driver is a prime example, as it creates regmaps that
don't belong to a single device, but are shared between different
drivers. In most cases, nobody ever binds a device to these regmaps.

The thing on which I need clarification is whether it is okay to bind a
device to these shared regmaps at all:

There is nothing preventing two different drivers from calling
regmap_attach_dev() on the same regmap (AFAICT, this is actually
happening when both imx_rproc and reset-imx7 are enabled, as both use
the same syscon "SRC").

There is also nothing preventing one driver from calling
regmap_attach_dev() while another is accessing the regmap.

What I'm trying to find out here is if there are any legitimate users
of regmap_attach_dev(). If there aren't any, we can remove the API and
don't need to fix it.
