Hmm.. I feel a little bit weired to treat ovp_segments as 'stat' class, one reason
is ovp_segments is readonly and is matching the readonly attribute of a stat.

Yes, there should be some alternative ways to help to access f2fs sysfs
interface, but from a point view of user, I'm not sure he can figure out those
ways.

For those fs meta stat, why not adding a single entry to include all info you
need rather than adding them one by one? e.g.

/proc/fs/f2fs/<disk>/super_block
/proc/fs/f2fs/<disk>/checkpoint
/proc/fs/f2fs/<disk>/nat_table
/proc/fs/f2fs/<disk>/sit_table
...

Thanks,
