Very good question, I think it's fine, would prefer it that way and will
be merge it, but ianal.

Right, we have some lingering patches on our side for this as well,
unfortunately I have one db82c0 that gets unstable when we bring the
last 2 CPUs up to speed.

I started looking at this and found that some care needs to be taken
when switching between the lower half and higher half of the frequencies
(or perhaps it was voltages?) Unfortunately I didn't conclude anything
in this area, but I would be happy to see this resolved.

I'm in agreement with you that we should vote for these somewhere, so
I'm fine with us agreeing that they are voted for here for now.

But if this happens you need to override the giant pinctrl-0 in such
device dts and hope that you don't miss any of the entries anyways.

Right, 100 is the new "limit", but 80 is still a good target. What I'm
opposing is that you wrap at 44.
