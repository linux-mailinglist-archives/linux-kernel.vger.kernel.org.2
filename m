FYI we are on 2 month cycle for -cip-rt, so we are still fine for a
while. We had trouble coordinating matching -cip and -rt releases, but
we decided to adjust -cip cycle to match -rt, so that should be solved.

We are aware, but I don't think we decided what will happen at that
point (and I can't really speak for the project). We plan to maintain
-cip and -cip-rt variants till 2027:

https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/civilinfrastructureplatform/start

Taking over -stable and -stable-rt maintainance, too, is something
that may make sense (and we probably will be considered), but it is
likely CIP Technical Steering Committee's (=E2=80=9CTSC=E2=80=9D) decision.

https://www.cip-project.org/about/charter

Actually, your input may be important here. If you (or SuSE or someone
else) can put some resources into 4.4-rt after February 2022, that
would be good to know.

Best regards,
								Pavel
(Again I don't speak for the project)
