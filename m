Thanks for the confirmation. I must have looked at your earlier patchset which only was registering with LED class framework and not having support to register with PWM framework for the channels that're not used for LEDs.

Yes, that should cover the use cases I was mentioning. We will look into your patch series to see if it can support our requirements.
