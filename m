IMHO, The fpga-mgr dev is also a data transfer. The fpga-region dev is
acting as the FPGA region admin responsible for gating, transfering and
re-enumerating.

So my opinion is to add a new data transfer type and keep a unified process.

The fpga-image-load driver knows the data will be stored in nvmem, while
the fpga-mgr knows the data will be stored in FPGA cells. They may need
to know the exact physical position to store, may not, depends on what the
HW engines are.

I think at least developers don't have to go through 2 sets of software
stacks which are of the same concept. And adding some new features like
optionally threading or canceling data transfer are also good to FPGA
region update. And the nvmem update could also be benifit from exsiting
implementations like scatter-gather buffers, in-kernel firmware loading.

I try to explain myself according to each of your concern from that mail
thread:

Purpose of the 2 updates
========================

  As I said before, I think they are both data transfer devices. FPGA
region update gets extra support from fpga-region & fpga-bridge, and
FPGA nvmem update could be a standalone fpga-mgr.

Extra APIs that are unique to nvmem update
==========================================

  cdev APIs for nvmem update:
    Yes we need to expand the functionality so we need them.

  available_images, image_load APIs for loading nvmem content to FPGA
  region:
    These are features in later patchsets which are not submitted, but we
    could talk about it in advance. I think this is actually a FPGA region
    update from nvmem, it also requires gating, data loading (no SW transfer)
    and re-enumeration, or a single command to image_load HW may result system
    disordered. The FPGA framework now only supports update from in-kernel
    user data, maybe we add support for update from nvmem later.

  fpga-mgr state extend:
    I think it could be extended, The current states are not perfect,
    adding something like IDLE or READY is just fine.

  fpga-mgr status extend:
    Add general error definitions as needed. If there is some status
    that is quite vendor specific, expose it in low-level driver.

  remaining-size:
    Nice to have for all.

Threading the update
====================

  Also a good option for FPGA region update, maybe we also have a slow FPGA
  reprogrammer?

Cancelling the update
====================

  Also a good option for FPGA region update if HW engine supports.

Thanks,
Yilun
