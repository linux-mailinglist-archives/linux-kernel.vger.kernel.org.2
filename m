It may be a pragmatic solution to the problem.
But it isn't 'correct'.
OTOH I think gcc is broken.
It ought to at least give a sane method of getting the warning
ignored in specific cases.

In order for gcc to consider (mdesc + 1) to have size 0
I think it must have tracked the pointer from a structure
that has another field (or structure end) following 'mdesc'.
If that is the case then it should also know that the data[]
must also be size 0.
So the warning may reappear with the next gcc version.

The busybox patch has:
+@@ -75,6 +75,7 @@ struct mdesc_handle {
+ 	refcount_t		refcnt;
+ 	unsigned int		handle_size;
+ 	struct mdesc_hdr	mdesc;
++	char			data[];
+ };


Which really ought to be more than enough.
Although the extra space could be considered to even be
outside that structure.
But the gcc folks suggested a completely brain-dead change
that requires taking the offset from the outer structure.
--	return (struct mdesc_elem *) (mdesc + 1);
++	return (struct mdesc_elem *) hp + offsetof(struct mdesc_handle, data);
which is probably missing a (char *) cast.

I wonder if it might be better to 'launder' the pointer
so that gcc can't track its size.
It may be that:
	return (struct mdesc_elem *)(ulong)(mdesc + 1);
is enough.
Otherwise it will need to be passed into an asm block.

But gcc is getting stupid for system programming.
