I had applied the V3 version of this patch series for testing
purposes, and then accidentally included in the dev branch.  So an
earlier version of this patch series has been in the ext4 git tree for
a while.  I've done a comparison between the V3 and V4 patches, and
aside from a minor whitespace change in patch #1, the only patch that
had any real changes was this one (#4).  Patch #5 was also added in
the V4 series.

So I've edited the ext4 git tree using rebase magic, replacing patch
#4 and adding patch #5.

In other words, this is a slightly more complicated, "Thanks,
applied".  :-)
