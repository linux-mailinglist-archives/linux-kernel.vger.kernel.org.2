This is the only API that can be used by the client drivers to pass the
configurations to the MHI stack. So we wanted to have a flags parameter that
could be extended in the future also.

Regarding "0", the default behaviour is to not pre allocate the buffer at all.
So it made less sense to add a separate flag or an API for that.
