That actually depends on the driver.

For instance, intel_pstate can be run with turbo (== boost) enabled or
disabled.  If turbo is enabled, cpuinfo.max_freq is the max turbo
frequency.

In acpi_cpufreq things are sort of weird, because the highest bin in
there is a turbo frequency, but not the max one and it is used to
enable the entire turbo range.  The driver sets cpuinfo.max_freq to
this one if boost is enabled IIRC.

Yes (but see above).

It is not used on x86 AFAICS.
