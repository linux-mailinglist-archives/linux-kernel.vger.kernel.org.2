Here is a log with 5.11.0-rc6:
https://lava.collabora.co.uk/scheduler/job/3187849
[dump_stack was added in some tegra-smmu functions]

And here is a corresponding log with reverting the original commit:
https://lava.collabora.co.uk/scheduler/job/3187851

Here is a log with 5.11.0-rc7-next-20210210:
https://lava.collabora.co.uk/scheduler/job/3210245

And here is a corresponding log with reverting the original commit:
https://lava.collabora.co.uk/scheduler/job/3210596

Both failing logs show that mc errors started right after client DC
got enabled by ->attach_dev() callback that in the passing logs was
not called until Host1x driver init. And note that two failing logs
show that ->attach_dev() could be called from two different sources,
of_dma_configure_id() or arch_setup_dma_ops().

The reason why ->attach_dev() gets called is probably related to the
following reasons (sorry, can't be 100% sure as I don't have Tegra124
or other 32bit Tegra board to test):
1) With the commit reverted, all clients are probed in "arch" stage,
   which is even prior to iommu core initialization -- including it
   setting default domain type. This probably messed up the type of
   allocating domains against the default domain type. Also internal
   group is somehow affected. So some condition check in iommu core
   failed and then it bypassed ->attach_dev callback in really_probe
   stage, until Host1x driver does attach_dev again.

2) 32bit ARM has arch_setup_dma_ops() does an additional set of iommu
   domain allocation + attach_dev(), after of_dma_configure_id() did
   once. This isn't reproducible for me on Tegra210.

As debugging online isn't very efficient, and given that Thierry has
been working on the linear mapping of framebuffer carveout, I choose
to partially revert as a quick fix.

Thanks
