It seems there are 2 concerns:
1. If data comes in and it's not in the size that is specified, it's
suspicious and should either be truncated or ignored. Maybe under
ignore, over truncate.

2. If the data is more than specified, it must be checked to see if
there are __data_loc / __rel_loc entries and they must be validated as
within range of accepted limits. If there are no __data_loc / __rel_loc
it should either be truncated or ignored.

Is there more that I may have missed?

I'd like to know if I do fix them that the features like filtering will still
be available to user_events or if it's better to just add flags to disable
kernel filtering?

I'm still unsure this is limited to just user_events.

For example, why doesn't filter_pred_strloc and filter_pred_pchar in
trace_events_filter.c check the boundary it will be accessing?

It seems like tracepoints from kernel modules, while more trusted, can also
cause this kind of thing due to bugs, etc.

Thanks,
