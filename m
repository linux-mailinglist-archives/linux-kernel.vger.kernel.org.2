I'm sorry.

Yes. The commit Johan referenced explains it in more detail.

Correct, I do and I am glad if people consider other aspects of the
kernel in their review including RT.

Okay. I added a sentence. What about this rewording:

  Force-threaded interrupt handlers used to run with interrupts enabled,
  something which could lead to deadlocks in case a threaded handler
  shared a lock with code running in hard interrupt context (e.g. timer
  callbacks) and did not explicitly disable interrupts. =20
 =20
  This was specifically the case for serial drivers that take the port
  lock in their console write path as printk can be called from hard
  interrupt context also with forced threading ("threadirqs").
 =20
  Since commit 81e2073c175b ("genirq: Disable interrupts for force
  threaded handlers") interrupt handlers always run with interrupts
  disabled on non-RT so that drivers no longer need to do handle this.
  RT is not affected by the referenced commit and the workaround, that is
  reverted, was not required because spinlock_t must not be acquired on
  RT in hardirq context.
 =20
  Drop the now obsolete workaround added by commit 33f16855dcb9 ("tty:
  serial: imx: fix potential deadlock").
