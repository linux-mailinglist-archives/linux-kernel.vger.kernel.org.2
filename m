Right. I don't see any reason why these shouldn't work. You may just 
need to add the enable for the lockdown, but you can reuse the basic 
infrastructure.

Thanks.

Yes [2] is indeed an alternative. We considered this at some point, but 
since we don't care about DOS in our case it seemed simpler to just 
harden the existing code.Â  But yes if it's there it's useful for TDX too.

FWIW I would argue that the descriptor boundary checking should be added 
in any case, security case or separated metadata or not, because it can 
catch bugs and is very cheap. Checking boundaries is good practice.

[4] would be an independent issue, that's something we didn't catch.

Also the swiotlb hardening implemented in this patchkit doesn't seem to 
be in any of the other patches.

So I would say my patches are mostly orthogonal to these patches below 
and not conflicting, even though they address a similar problem space.
