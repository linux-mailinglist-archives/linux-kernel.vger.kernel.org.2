ok, i will roll back to original patch and add the second patch for max 
link rate limited purpose.
panel dpcd specified max link rate it supported.
At driver, link rate is derived from dpcd directly since driver will try 
to use the maximum supported link rate and less lane to save power.
Therefore it is not possible that limit link rate base on dpcd.
AS i understand we are going to do max link rate limitation is due to 
old redriver chip can not support HBR3.
How can I acquire which type-c port on the board so that I can trigger 
max link rate limitation?
