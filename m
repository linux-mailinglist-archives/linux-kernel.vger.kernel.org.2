Good to know, thank you!  I believe that all the needed locks are already
raw spinlocks, but the actual kernel code always takes precedence over
one's beliefs.

At this point, I am going to say that it is the sysadm's job to place
the rcuo kthreads, and if they are placed poorly, life is hard.

This means that I need to create a couple of additional polling RCU
grace-period functions for rcutorture's priority-boosting use, but I
probably should have done that a long time ago.  Simpler to just call a
polling API occasionally than to handle all the corner cases of keeping
an RCU callback queued.

There are some timers that are used to cause a wakeup to happen from
a clean environment, but maybe these can instead use irq-work.

That it can!  Aravinda Prasad prototyped a mechanism hinting to the
hypervisor in such cases, but I don't know that this ever saw the light
of day.

Sounds good, thank you!
