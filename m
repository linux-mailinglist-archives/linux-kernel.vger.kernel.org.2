You can no longer escape the rlimit of the creator of the user
namespace, by creating multiple users inside of the user namespace.  The
users (in the user namespace) will have their individual rlimits but
are jointly by the limit of the creator of the user namespace at the
time the user namespace was created.

Which is a perfectly fine justification.  However the justification
presented in the change log was that there is no existing limit, and
that is what is factually wrong.

Different kinds of limits serve different purposes.  An accounting of how
many instance of a resource has been used serve the purpose of detecting
when an application has gone completely out of spec.

Limits like you are implementing here are much better for just sharing and
managing system resources.

The limits I am talking about are not useful to the OOM killer as
usually the amount of resources that indicates something has gone wrong
are too small to be a system-wide problem.

So please just correct the justification in the commit message and I
will be happy.
