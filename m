I see SMEM is in arch init call, Updated in v12 to register driver in 
late_init by the time SMEM would have probed already and should not need 
to handle -EPROBE_DEFER.

Ok updated driver to not use SMEM for RPM based targets for existing 
upstream targets (when such target goes upstream in future which uses 
SMEM for subsystem stats we can enable back with new compatible say -v2).
