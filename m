Well I am definitely for keeping this bug as a feature
and utilizing UHS with this patch ;)
I have tried all SDSC cards I could get my hands on and
have not seen any 'accidentally' reporting UHS support.

I tested the patch with own custom cards.
(Hyperstone, my employer, develops controllers for flash
storage.)

There you would have to make the same choice, disabling
UHS support reporting for all SDSC cards, but as some
hosts accept UHS (including voltage switch) without checking
CCS, this would throttle performance.
(One such host is e.g.
8564:4000 Transcend Information, Inc. microSD/SD/CF UHS-II Card Reader)

It would be nice to have this in linux-mmc as arguably the most
important SD native host.
I'm sure the other manufacturers either do not disable UHS
support for SDSC cards, or have at least been playing with the idea.

Regards,
Christian

Thanks for the links!

Are these the ones that you have been using for testing?

Right. I have a whole bunch of old SD cards that I can test. I will
let you know when I have got some time to test some of them.

The main worry (but I may be wrong) I have with the patch is that it
could cause problems for other older SDSC cards, which happens to
incorrectly set the S18A bit. I mean, before UHS-I was introduced in
the SD spec, this bit was just being reserved and potentially it could
have *any* value by the card manufacturer. As I said, let me do some
tests of my older SD cards.

Ah, yes you are right!

We call mmc_sd_init_uhs_card() no matter whether the CCS bit is set.
Certainly this is a bug. Both the card and host aren't designed to
work under these conditions/timings.
