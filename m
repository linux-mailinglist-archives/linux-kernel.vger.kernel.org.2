I can't argue with either of your points.

The rust code is alredy coming though ...

rust/kernel/buffer.rs:/// A pre-allocated buffer that implements [`core::fmt::Write`].

so now we have three formats.  Markdown and RST are _very_ similar, but
not identical [1].  Oh, and even better we now have three distinct tools --
kerneldoc, rustdoc and sphinx.  Have the rust people reached out to you
about integrating the various docs?
