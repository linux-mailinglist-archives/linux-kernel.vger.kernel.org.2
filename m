Dearest,

I know this mail will come to you as a surprise since we haven't known
or come across each other before considering the fact that I sourced
your email contact through the Internet in search of trusted person
who can assist me.

I am Miss Manuella Warlord Ibrahim Coulibaly 24 years old female from
the Republic of Ivory Coast,West Africa ,am the Daughter of Late Chief
Sgt.Warlord Ibrahim Coulibaly (a.k.a General IB ). My late father was
a well known Ivory Coast militia leader . He died on Thursday 28 April
2011 following a fight with the Republican Forces of Ivory
Coast(FRCI). I am constrained to contact you because of the
maltreatment which I am receiving from my step mother.

She planned to take away all my late father's treasury and properties
from me since the unexpected death of my beloved Father. Meanwhile I
wanted to travel to Europe, but she hide away my international
passport and other valuable documents. Luckily she did not discover
where I kept my father's File which contained important documents. Now
I am presently staying in the Mission in Ghana.

I am seeking for long term relationship and investment assistance. My
father of blessed memory deposited the sum of US$ 27.5 Million in one
bank in Accra Ghana with my name as the next of kin. I had contacted
the Bank to clear the deposit but the Branch Manager told me that
being a refugee, my status according to the local law does not
authorize me to carry out the operation. However, he advised me to
provide a trustee who will stand on my behalf. I had wanted to inform
my stepmother about this deposit but I am afraid that she will not
offer me anything after the release of the money.

Therefore, I decide to seek for your help in transferring the money
into your bank account while I will relocate to your country and
settle down with you. As you indicated your interest to help me I will
give you the account number and the contact of the bank where my late
beloved father deposited the money with my name as the next of kin. It
is my intention to compensate you with 40% of the total money for your
assistance and the balance shall be my investment in any profitable
venture which you will recommend to me as have no any idea about
foreign investment. Please all communications should be through this
email address for confidential purposes (
manuellawarlordibrahimw@gmail.com ).

Thanking you a lot in anticipation of your quick response. I will give
you details in my next mail after receiving your acceptance mail to
help me ,

Yours sincerely
Miss manuella Warlord Ibrahim Coulibaly
