I understand what local_lock is for. For !RT kernel, local_lock() still 
requires the use of a pseudo_lock which is not the goal of this patch to 
put one there.

That is right. So this is a change aimed for easier integration with RT 
kernel.

Well, I can do that if you want me to.

The purpose of this series is to improve kmem_cache allocation and free 
performance for non-RT kernel. So not disabling/enabling interrupt help 
a bit in this regard.

That comment was added by commit 72f0184c8a00 ("mm, memcg: remove 
hotplug locking from try_charge"). It was there before my commits.

That is correct specifically for task_obj, but not for other data.

I haven't done a full analysis to see if it can be called from task 
context only. Maybe in_task() check isn't needed, but having it there 
provides the safety that it will still work in case it can be called 
from interrupt context.

What is your suggestion for improving this patch?
