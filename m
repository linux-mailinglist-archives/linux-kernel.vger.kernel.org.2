Subject: [PATCH v3] docs: checkpatch: Document and segregate more checkpatch message types
Date:   Fri, 11 Jun 2021 11:38:33 +0530

Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Add and document more checkpatch message types. About 50% of all
message types are documented now.

In addition to this:

- Create a new subsection 'Indentation and Line Breaks'.
- Rename subsection 'Comment style' to simply 'Comments'.
- Refactor some of the existing types to appropriate subsections.

Changes in v3:
- Update explanation for CONSTANT_CONVERSION
- Add more reference links
- Fix grammatical errors

Changes in v2:
- Correct DEVICE_ATTR message types as suggested by Joe Perches.
  https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/eab0487d7b4e68badbbe0505b2a7903b9d8931c4.camel@perches.com/T/#t
- Use passive voice in the documentation

+  **CONSTANT_CONVERSION**
+    Use of __constant_<foo> form is discouraged for the following functions::
+
+      __constant_cpu_to_be[x]
+      __constant_cpu_to_le[x]
+      __constant_be[x]_to_cpu
+      __constant_le[x]_to_cpu
+      __constant_htons
+      __constant_ntohs
+
+    Using any of these outside of include/uapi/ is not preferred as using the
+    function without __constant_ is identical when the argument is a
+    constant.
+
+    In big endian systems, the macros like __constant_cpu_to_be32(x) and
+    cpu_to_be32(x) expand to the same expression::
+
+      #define __constant_cpu_to_be32(x) ((__force __be32)(__u32)(x))
+      #define __cpu_to_be32(x)          ((__force __be32)(__u32)(x))
+
+    In little endian systems, the macros __constant_cpu_to_be32(x) and
+    cpu_to_be32(x) expand to __constant_swab32 and __swab32.  __swab32
+    has a __builtin_constant_p check::
+
+      #define __swab32(x)				\
+        (__builtin_constant_p((__u32)(x)) ?	\
+        ___constant_swab32(x) :			\
+        __fswab32(x))
+
+    So ultimately they have a special case for constants.
+    Similar is the case with all of the macros in the list.  Thus
+    using the __constant_... forms are unnecessarily verbose and
+    not preferred outside of include/uapi.
+
+    See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1400106425.12666.6.camel@joe-AO725/
+
+  **DEPRECATED_API**
+    Usage of a deprecated RCU API is detected.  It is recommended to replace
+    old flavourful RCU APIs by their new vanilla-RCU counterparts.
+
+    The full list of available RCU APIs can be viewed from the kernel docs.
+
+    See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/RCU/whatisRCU.html#full-list-of-rcu-apis
+
+  **DEPRECATED_VARIABLE**
+    EXTRA_{A,C,CPP,LD}FLAGS are deprecated and should be replaced by the new
+    flags added via commit f77bf01425b1 ("kbuild: introduce ccflags-y,
+    asflags-y and ldflags-y").
+
+    The following conversion scheme maybe used::
+
+      EXTRA_AFLAGS    ->  asflags-y
+      EXTRA_CFLAGS    ->  ccflags-y
+      EXTRA_CPPFLAGS  ->  cppflags-y
+      EXTRA_LDFLAGS   ->  ldflags-y

+
+  **DEVICE_ATTR_FUNCTIONS**
+    The function names used in DEVICE_ATTR is unusual.
+    Typically, the store and show functions are used with <attr>_store and
+    <attr>_show, where <attr> is a named attribute variable of the device.
+
+    Consider the following examples::
+
+      static DEVICE_ATTR(type, 0444, type_show, NULL);
+      static DEVICE_ATTR(power, 0644, power_show, power_store);
+
+    The function names should preferably follow the above pattern.
+
+    See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/driver-model/device.html#attributes
+
+  **DEVICE_ATTR_RO**
+    The DEVICE_ATTR_RO(name) helper macro can be used instead of
+    DEVICE_ATTR(name, 0444, name_show, NULL);
+
+    Note that the macro automatically appends _show to the named
+    attribute variable of the device for the show method.
+
+    See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/driver-model/device.html#attributes
+
+  **DEVICE_ATTR_RW**
+    The DEVICE_ATTR_RW(name) helper macro can be used instead of
+    DEVICE_ATTR(name, 0644, name_show, name_store);
+
+    Note that the macro automatically appends _show and _store to the
+    named attribute variable of the device for the show and store methods.
+
+    See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/driver-model/device.html#attributes
+
+  **DEVICE_ATTR_WO**
+    The DEVICE_AATR_WO(name) helper macro can be used instead of
+    DEVICE_ATTR(name, 0200, NULL, name_store);
+
+    Note that the macro automatically appends _store to the
+    named attribute variable of the device for the store method.
+
+    See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/driver-model/device.html#attributes
+
+  **DUPLICATED_SYSCTL_CONST**
+    Commit d91bff3011cf ("proc/sysctl: add shared variables for range
+    check") added some shared const variables to be used instead of a local
+    copy in each source file.
+
+    Consider replacing the sysctl range checking value with the shared
+    one in include/linux/sysctl.h.  The following conversion scheme may
+    be used::
+
+      &zero     ->  SYSCTL_ZERO
+      &one      ->  SYSCTL_ONE
+      &int_max  ->  SYSCTL_INT_MAX
+
+    See:
+

+
+  **ENOSYS**
+    ENOSYS means that a nonexistent system call was called.
+    Earlier, it was wrongly used for things like invalid operations on
+    otherwise valid syscalls.  This should be avoided in new code.
+
+    See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/5eb299021dec23c1a48fa7d9f2c8b794e967766d.1408730669.git.luto@amacapital.net/
+
+  **ENOTSUPP**
+    ENOTSUPP is not a standard error code and should be avoided in new patches.
+    EOPNOTSUPP should be used instead.
+
+    See: https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20200510182252.GA411829@lunn.ch/
+
+  **EXPORT_SYMBOL**
+    EXPORT_SYMBOL should immediately follow the symbol to be exported.
+
   **IN_ATOMIC**
     in_atomic() is not for driver use so any such use is reported as an ERROR.
-    Also in_atomic() is often used to determine if we may sleep, but it is not
-    reliable in this use model therefore its use is strongly discouraged.
+    Also in_atomic() is often used to determine if sleeping is permitted,

+Indentation and Line Breaks
+---------------------------
+
+  **CODE_INDENT**
+    Code indent should use tabs instead of spaces.
+    Outside of comments, documentation and Kconfig,
+    spaces are never used for indentation.
+
+    See: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html#indentation
+
+  **DEEP_INDENTATION**
+    Indentation with 6 or more tabs usually indicate overly indented
+    code.
+
+    It is suggested to refactor excessive indentation of
+    if/else/for/do/while/switch statements.
+
+    See: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1328311239.21255.24.camel@joe2Laptop/
+
+  **SWITCH_CASE_INDENT_LEVEL**
+    switch should be at the same indent as case.

+      case 'G':
+      case 'g':

+
+  **LONG_LINE**
+    The line has exceeded the specified maximum length.
+    To use a different maximum line length, the --max-line-length=n option
+    may be added while invoking checkpatch.
+
+    Earlier, the default line length was 80 columns.  Commit bdc48fa11e46
+    ("checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning") increased the
+    limit to 100 columns.  This is not a hard limit either and it's
+    preferable to stay within 80 columns whenever possible.

+
+  **LONG_LINE_STRING**
+    A string starts before but extends beyond the maximum line length.
