The explanation about why the superblock isn't encrypted seems a bit backwards.
It makes it sound like this decision was mainly an accident because of how f2fs
is currently implemented.  But actually we need to leave the superblock
unencrypted anyway in order to keep the filesystem type and metadata encryption
options readable from disk, so that the filesystem can be mounted without
knowing the filesystem type and encryption options ahead of time -- right?
I.e. would anything actually be different if it was super easy to encrypt the
superblock in the kernel?

This can use !IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_FS_ENCRYPTION_METADATA).

Should this show the encryption algorithm too?  Maybe:

"Metadata encryption enabled; algorithm=%s, key_identifier=%*phN"

Note that showing the "fscrypt:" key description prefix doesn't really add
anything, so I recommend leaving it out.

... or 0 if none.

... (if metadata_crypt_alg != 0)
