Thanks for clarifying. To be honest, I'm not sure if the WARN_ON() in
smem is very useful since this isn't really fundamentally different as
if the entry is not allocated. But at the end all that matters is that
there are no warnings when loading this driver on older targets.

The driver can also be built-in and in this case this is not guaranteed.
This actually happened to me when I tried this on MSM8916: I did not get
the WARNINGs because all the qcom_smem_get() just returned -EPROBE_DEFER.
qcom_smem was then probed after qcom_sleep_stats. Of course, the smem
items are not present there anyway so it did not matter.

OK, I don't seem to have any recent Qualcomm platform that actually has
subsystem stats in SMEM so it doesn't bother me. I just wanted to
mention it for reference. :)

Thanks!
