Yes, you can either do ioctl or with the v2 patch you can now just cat
user_events_status as you indicated previously to do :)

Please see v2 patch, I do this pattern except it's '(Used by ftrace)'
instead of '# Used by ftrace'.

Format is id:name status

Yes, I didn't say it's impossible :) It's quite hard and takes a lot
more management. I don't see a clear benefit to that approach, why is it
better than an fd lifetime? Not trying to be difficult, just trying to
be pragmatic about what approach is best.

With this patch I have no problem getting hist, trigger and filter to
work since the user is providing all correct offsets. Can you help me
understand why this won't work? (It appears to work well without the
kernel modifying user provided memory).

Adding the common fields is fine, and works well with the current patch.
I've been able to decode in ftrace, perf and eBPF without any issues for
common types. __data_loc needs user mode cooperation, but no other type
does. I've also tested hist, filter and trigger and all appear to work
as I understand them to.

What's the difference between __rel_loc__ and __data_loc? Seems like
instead of just offset it's length + offset?
