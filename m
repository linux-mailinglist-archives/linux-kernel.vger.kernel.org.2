We tracked down the slowdowns to be caused by two major contributors:

- for a reason that we do not fully understand yet the same cpufreq
governor (conservative) did not cause alloc_contig_range() to be slowed
down on 4.9 as much as it it with 5.4, running tests with the
performance cpufreq governor works a tad better and the results are more
consistent from run to run with a smaller variation.

- another large contributor to the slowdown was having enabled
CONFIG_IRQSOFF_TRACER. After c3bc8fd637a9623f5c507bd18f9677effbddf584
("tracing: Centralize preemptirq tracepoints and unify their usage") we
now prepare arguments for tracing even if we end-up not using them since
tracing is not enabled at runtime. Getting the caller function's return
address is cheap on arm64 for level == 0, but getting the preceding
caller involves doing a backtrace walk which is expensive (see
arch/arm64/kernel/return_address.c).

So with these two variables eliminated we are only about x2 slower on
5.4 than we were on 4.9 and this is acceptable for our use case. I would
not say the case is closed but at least we understand it better. We now
have 5.10 brought up to speed so any new investigation will be focused
on that kernel.

Thanks a lot for your help David!
