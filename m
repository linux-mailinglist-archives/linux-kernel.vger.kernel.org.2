Okay, will change it.

As the temp-alarm has interrupt support, whenever preconfigured 
threshold violates it notifies thermal framework, so I think the polling 
delay is not needed here.

Yeah, this is not required here will remove it.

yes I agree, the system will shutdown when we hit the 1st critical, 2nd 
critical point is not needed. Probably this got carried from old change 
propagation, will remove it.
