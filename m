RB5 board is based on SM8250 SoC and coresight is a SoC level IP (won't
change per board, although can be disabled per board) and as such these
coresight dt nodes should be in sm8250.dtsi (please look at other 
examples
in SM8150/SC7180/SC7280).

Similarly SMMU support is not per board (RB5), it's already supported
for SM8250 long time back (check for apps_smmu in sm8250.dtsi), so you
can add ETR support when you post v3 (note this patch which you have
posted should have been v3 as v2 was your previous version). You can 
just
post one patch with the coresight dt entries as the ETM driver patch is
already queued by Suzuki in coresight tree. You can use the following 
qcom
tree [1] when posting DT for QCOM devices (branch: for-next), also 
please
remember to *sort the nodes by address*.
