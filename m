The parted command, used to list the partitions, will open the disk in RW mode which results in systemd-udevd re-reading the partitions. This will trigger the rescan partitions which will also delete and re-add the partitions. So, both iscsi logout processing and the parted (through systemd-udevd) will be involved in add/delete of partitions. In our case, the following sequence of operations happened (the iscsi device is /dev/sdb with partition sdb1):

After kworker is started for logout, I guess all IOs are supposed to be failed
at that time, so just wondering why 'sdb1' is still added by parted(systemd-udev)? 
ioctl(BLKRRPART) needs to read partition table for adding back partitions, if IOs
are failed by iscsi logout, I guess the issue can be avoided too?
