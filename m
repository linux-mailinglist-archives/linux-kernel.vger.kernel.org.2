I still do not see how the race is possible give the goal to prevent
module removal if a sysfs file is being used. If rmmod is taking
place, this simply will bail out.

That is dependent upon the intrastructure tests built for a driver.

In the case of fstests and blktests we have drivers which *always* get
removed and loaded on each test. Take for instance scsi_debug, which
creates / destroys virtual devices on the per test. Likewise, to build
confidence that failure rate is as close as possible to 0, one must run
a test as many times as possible in a loop. And, to build confidence in
a test, in some situations one ends up running modprobe / rmmod in a
loop.

In this case a customer does have a complex system of tests, and by looking
at the crash logs I managed to simplify the way to reproduce it using
simple shell scripts.
