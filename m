Yes, power consumption is a lot of fun :-(.

I know about postmarketOS (I even contributed a bit some time ago),
and watch it from time to time. Currently I'm using old Nokia 6151 for
phone calls, but would not mind switching. Work is ongoing in Droid 4
land -- phone calls are also "almost there". But the almost seems to
be a lot of work :-(.

Best regards,
