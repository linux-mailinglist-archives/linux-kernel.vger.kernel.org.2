Right, in case of RPMh, there was no separate 'enable' request which
could be sent, there was just a 'corner' request.

I don't completely recall, but the reason to not send a 'default corner'
on enable was perhaps to keep the enable and set_performance orthogonal.

However, given we then decided to send the lowest possible corner
in disable, it perhaps makes sense to send a 'lowest non-zero corner' on enable
as well.

So the index value represents the hlvl (0-15) that eventually gets sent to
rpmh, the pd->levels are the sparse vlvl values that come from the command
DB mappings.

What seems sane is to sent the lowest non-zero vlvl. That in most cases
would be at index 1, but for some which do not support complete off,
it could be at index 0.
