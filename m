I haven't heard of anything called a 'physical corner'. These were always
referred to as virtual corners, on older platforms it was just one contiguous
number space, on newer ones we added another higher level sparse number space
just for more fun :)
Command DB refers to these as hlvl and vlvl, I haven;t yet figured out what their
full forms are :/
