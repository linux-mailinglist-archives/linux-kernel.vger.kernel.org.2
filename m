Right I'm not suggesting to disable hpd interrupt, just the hpd_irq
interrupt once an unplug irq comes in, and do that in hardirq context.
Also, I'm suggesting that we consider unplug as a higher priority if the
hard irq handler is delayed for some reason and both an unplug irq and
an hpd irq are pending in the hardware when the hard irq handler is
running. Putting the dongle into D3 state won't fix these problems.
