Agree it's tricky how we treat the boost frequencies and also combine
them with thermal pressure.
We probably would have consider these design bits:
1. Should thermal pressure include boost frequency?
2. Should max capacity 1024 be a boost frequency so scheduler
    would see it explicitly?
- if no, then schedutil could still request boost freq thanks to
   map_util_perf() where we add 25% to the util and then
   map_util_freq() would return a boost freq when util was > 1024


I can see in schedutil only one place when cpuinfo.max_freq is used:
get_next_freq(). If the value stored in there is a boost,
then don't we get a higher freq value for the same util?
