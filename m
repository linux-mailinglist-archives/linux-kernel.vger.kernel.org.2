OK, got it. If I understand correctly, what you need is to not allow
reconfigure if the nbd disk is mounted, right?

Your solution needs change from userspace side, so it isn't flexible.

We can avoid reconfigure if the nbd disk is opened exclusively, such as
mount, please see if the following patch can solve your probelm:
