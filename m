What exactly does this mitigation do? This should be documented somewhere,
maybe in the Kconfig text?

The big problem I have with this is that it's a compile-time decision.
For the other spectre crap we have a combination of the "mitigations=off"
command-line and CPU detection to avoid the cost of the mitigation where
it is not deemed necessary.

So I think that either we enable this unconditionally, or we don't enable it
at all (and people can hack their CFLAGS themselves if they want to). It
would be helpful for one of the Arm folks to chime in, as I'm yet to see any
evidence that this is actually exploitable. Is it any worse that Spectre-v1,
where we _don't_ have a compiler mitigation?

Finally, do we have to worry about our assembly code?
