I expected something like this. In new patch version I tried to disable all
functionality which should not work in Upgrade/Failure mode.

Basically, I am interested in getting /dev/tpm0 working when TPM is in limited mode.
In this state, the TPM is not capable to provide any other functionality except firmware
upgrade/recovery. So the rest of features should be disabled/removed.
Physical reset of the TPM is mandatory part of the firmware upgrade/recovery. Which will
lead to driver rebind/reload and reappearance of all interfaces applicable to normal operational
mode.
