Pulling a single task is taking _a full millisecond_, which I see as a
mountain of cycles, directly through which you open a path for wakeups.
That "poking holes" isn't meant to be some kind of crude derogatory
remark, it's just the way I see what was done.  The mountain still
stands, you didn't remove it.

Try to include fair class in any LB improvement if at all possible,
because that's where most of the real world benefit is to be had.

Agreed.  But.  Specifically because the result remains intolerable to
anything remotely sensitive, users running such on their big boxen are
not going to be doing mixed load, that flat does not work, which is why
I said the patch set looks a bit like a noop: it excludes the audience
that stands to gain.. nearly anything.  Big box HPC (acronym includes
RT) gains absolutely nothing, as does big box general case with its not
particularly prevalent, but definitely existent RT tasks.  Big box
users who are NOT running anything they care deeply about do receive
some love.. but don't care deeply, and certainly don't care more any
more deeply than general case users do about these collision induced
latency spikes.
