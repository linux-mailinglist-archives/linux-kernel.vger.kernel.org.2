Phew, since you do, I can now disclose it was me.

The idea was not build-time, but runtime (hidden behind lockdep, VM_DEBUG or
whatnot), i.e.:

<sched_expert> what that code needs is switch(item) { case foo1: case foo2:
lockdep_assert_irqs_disabled(); break; case bar1: case bar2:
lockdep_assert_preempt_disabled(); lockdep_assert_no_in_irq(); break; } or
something along those lines
