Thanks for the ima_policy=tcb pointer.

I tested my patch with:
  - duplicate buffer content for "measure func=CRITICAL_DATA"
  - and reading the same file twice with "measure func=FILE_CHECK 
mask=MAY_READ"

In both the above use cases, IMA is measuring the duplicate entries with 
the patch, and not measuring the duplicate entries w/o the patch.

I will test the "ima_policy=tcb" boot-scenario as you suggested, before 
posting the next version.

Thanks,
Tushar
