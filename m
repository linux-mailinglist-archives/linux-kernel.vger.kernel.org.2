Hi,


I'm not sure I can agree. Especially for regions like IPA and TZ-reserved, which seem the same on (almost?) all..


Sure, the configuration for various remoteprocs *can* differ based on what the vendor decided to go with, but more often than not (especially with phones) vendors just take a MTP or CDP design, add a screen, couple of cameras and call it their own (you can tell by how similar most of them to the original reference designs in DT). While this is usually the case with lower-end (so not exactly sdm845) devices, it also kinda applies here...


I guess for this one, we should find the lowest common denominator and keep the nodes that are in the majority of devices in 845 DTSI and only alter them if need be.. For WoA devices that may stray further away, you can just add a label to reserved-memory and /delete-node/ it, so that you can rewrite it cleanly. The proposed approach just adds a lot - A LOT - of duplication. It will REALLY bite after more people submit 845-based phones, of which there are plenty (4 Xperias, a whole lot of Xiaomis, a couple of Samsungs, LGs... need I go on?).
