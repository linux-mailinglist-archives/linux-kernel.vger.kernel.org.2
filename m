Would just a 'skip_psp_init_on_probe' parameter be simpler. We default
to false but if users set it, we can skip that init attempt in
sev_pci_init(). The init attempts on all other commands that require
the INIT state would then provide users with INIT_EX functionality.
They would also know exactly when INIT or INIT_EX would be attempted
based on the parameter.

Otherwise a new ioctl sounds reasonable.
