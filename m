Subject: [GIT PULL] TPM DEVICE DRIVER changes for v5.12

Hi Linus,

This now my "official" first PR for v5.12. There's still some known issues
in the tpm_tis driver *not& fixed in this first pull request, which trigger a
warning but do not overally collapse the kernel by any means.

The fixes are in good progress, but unfortunately there's still some fine
tuning required before I can include to a pull request. I'm sure we will
get them done around rc2/rc3. Better to make sure that the fixes do right
things right, rather than rush them to a PR.

That's also the reason why this comes so late. Sorry about that. I have
also kind of "reorg" going on with my maintainer workflows, given the
increased review activity in keyrings and SGX, which temporarily causes
a bit overhead until becoming "status quo".

New features
============

1. Cr50 I2C TPM driver.
2. Sysfs exports of PCR registers in TPM 2.0 chips.

Bug fixes
=========

*  This contains bug fixes for tpm_tis driver, which had a racy wait for
   hardware state change to be ready to send a command to the TPM chip. The
   bug has existed already since 2006, but has only made itself known in
   recent past. This is the same as the "last time" :-)
*  Otherwise there's bunch of fixes for not as alarming regressions. I
   think the list is about the same as last time, except I added fixes for
   some disjoint bugs in trusted keys that I found some time ago.
