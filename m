Sure, I'll try to get it changed there, too.

Well, it's about a default configuration that should be fine for most users. 
I don't think that anybody really uses virtio-console in a ramdisk already 
... or are you really doing that in your CI? If so, then please disregard my 
patch.

Otherwise, I think compiling this as a module is the better choice, since 
most people won't use this at all during run-time, or maybe just use it for 
thing like communicating with the QEMU guest agent, but this is then 
certainly not required during boot up yet and thus the "m" should be fine, too.

> Is any distro using the defconfig unmodified?

Most likely don't. But it's a template for new configs, so we should use 
good defaults here.
