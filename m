Yes, exactly, thanks Russell for clarifying this.
How this works (when it does) is that the UART driver probes, then we
look at the children of the UART devicetree node, to probe for those, by
virtue of the serdev bus.

My question was about if this rings a bell with someone, because I have
a hard time piecing together how a delay in the *UART probe* could
affect devices depending on it. And how to fix this ...

Cheers,
Andre
