So back to something more like my original patch then?

We can cache page->memcg_data before calling put_page_testzero(),
just like we cache the Head flag in Johannes' patch.

I think you're confused in that last assertion.  According to
linux-fullhistory, the first introduction of __free_pages was 2.3.29pre3
(September 1999), where it did indeed use put_page_testzero:

+extern inline void __free_pages(struct page *page, unsigned long order)
+{
+       if (!put_page_testzero(page))
+               return;
+       __free_pages_ok(page, order);
+}

Before that, we had only free_pages() and __free_page().

We did discuss that possibility prior to the introduction of
e320d3012d25.  Here's one such:
