Whoops, misses ("...") around the title.

Sorry, I am ashamed to do this, but now I renege and say NAK:
better now than before Andrew picks it up.

The first reason occurred to me this morning.  I thought I had been
clever to spot the PageHead race which you fix here.  But now I just feel
very stupid not to have spotted the very similar memcg_data race.  The
speculative racer may call mem_cgroup_uncharge() from __put_single_page(),
and the new call to split_page_memcg() do nothing because page_memcg(head)
is already NULL.

And is it even safe there, to sprinkle memcg_data through all of those
order-0 subpages, when free_the_page() is about to be applied to a
series of descending orders?  I could easily be wrong, but I think
free_pages_prepare()'s check_free_page() will find that is not
page_expected_state().

And what gets to do the uncharging when memcg_data is properly set
on the appropriate order-N subpages?  I believe it's the (second)
__memcg_kmem_uncharge_page() in free_pages_prepare(), but that's
only called if PageMemcgKmem().  Ah, good, Roman's changes have put
that flag into memcg_data, so it will automatically be set: but this
patch will not port back to 5.10 without some addition.

But, after all that, I'm now thinking that Matthew's original
e320d3012d25 ("mm/page_alloc.c: fix freeing non-compound pages")
is safer reverted.  The put_page_testzero() in __free_pages() was
not introduced for speculative pagecache: it was there in 2.4.0,
and atomic_dec_and_test() in 2.2, I don't have older trees to hand.

So, it has "always" been accepted that multiple references to a
high-order non-compound page can be given out and released: maybe
they were all released with __free_pages() of the right order, or
maybe only the last had to get that right; but as __free_pages()
stands today, all but the last caller frees all but the first
subpage.  A very rare leak seems much safer.

I don't have the answer (find somewhere in struct page to squirrel
away the order, even when it's a non-compound page?), and I think
each of us would much rather be thinking about other things at the
moment.  But for now it looks to me like NAK to this patch, and
revert of e320d3012d25.

Done, and Sasha has picked them up.  But in writing that "Ah, good,
Roman's changes ..." paragraph, I've begun to wonder if what I sent
was complete - does a 5.10 split_page_memcg(), when called from
split_page(), also need to copy head's PageKmemcg? I rather think
yes, but by now I'm unsure of everything...
