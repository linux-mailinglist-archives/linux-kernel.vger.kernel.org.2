Ah, OK. I misunderstood the idea.
per-FD model sounds like having events/user-events/*/marker file.

It depends on the use case, how much events you wants to use with
the user-events. If there are hundreds of the evets, that will consume
kernel resources and /proc/*/fd/ will be filled with the event's fds.
But if there is a few events, I think no problem.

You can add the 'ID' field commonly in the user-event by default
if you need it. Or, just skip the ID as it is a header of the packet.
(since the ID is process local number, that will not important for
the tracers who trace the events by name)

OK, I got it. I hope no one adds hundreds of events at once for
trace.
