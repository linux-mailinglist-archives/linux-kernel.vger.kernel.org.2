The patch is indeed based on that commit. The reason behind it is that the
values for *head are being wrapped in the driver side (see the macro
PERF_IDX2OFF which is used at various points in 
/drivers/perf/arm_spe_pmu.c).

If this callback is not to be added, I believe the driver needs to be 
updated
first so that the head pointer monotonically increases like in cs-etm. 
Do you
think this makes sense for SPE?

(note that the patch will skip the wrap-around detection if this is the 
case,
in order to handle both cases in the userspace perf tool).

Thanks,
German
