Although I have to say that the code is quite tricky and it deserves
more comments. See below.

Just by looking at this in isolation one could be really curious how
does this not break the low memory protection altogether. The logic is
spread over 3 different places.

Would something like the following be more understandable?

			/*
			 * Low limit protected memcgs are already excluded at
			 * a higher level (shrink_node_memcgs) but scaling
			 * down the reclaim target can result in hard to
			 * reclaim and premature OOM. We do not have a full
			 * picture here so we cannot really judge this
			 * sutuation here but pro-actively flag this scenario
			 * and let do_try_to_free_pages to retry if
			 * there is no progress.
