no,
At this time display is off. this mean dp controller is off and mainlink 
has teared down.
it will start with plug in interrupt to bring dp controller up and start 
link training.
irq_hpd can be generated only panel is at run time of operation mode and 
need attention from host.
If host is shutting down, then no need to service pending irq_hpd.

event q just like bottom half of irq handler. it turns irq into event 
and handle them sequentially.
irq_hpd is asynchronous event from panel to bring up attention of hsot 
during run time of operation.
Here, the dongle is unplugged and main link had teared down so that no 
need to service pending irq_hpd if any.
