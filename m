Looking into this again, I think we actually can't easily track this
state ourselves outside struct pci_dev. The reason for this is that
when e.g. arch/s390/pci/pci_sysfs.c:recover_store() removes the struct
pci_dev and scans it again the new struct pci_dev re-uses the same
struct zpci_dev because from a platform point of view the PCI device
was never removed but only disabled and re-enabled. Thus we can only
distinguish the stale struct pci_dev by looking at things stored in
struct pci_dev itself.

That said, I think for the recovery case we might be able to drop the
pci_dev_is_added() and rely on pdev->driver != NULL which we check
anyway and that should catch any PCI device that was already removed.
