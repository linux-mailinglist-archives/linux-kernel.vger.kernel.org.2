In general I can't disagree.  However, you *are* modifying at least 
commit 048f49809c in your backport, so it's not clear where you draw the 
line and why you didn't ask for help (more on this below).

Only the first five patches here are actual prerequisites for an easy 
backport of the two commits that actually matter (a835429cda91, "KVM: 
x86/mmu: Ensure TLBs are flushed when yielding during GFN range zap"; 
and 048f49809c52, "KVM: x86/mmu: Ensure TLBs are flushed for TDP MMU 
during NX zapping", 2021-03-30).  Everything after "KVM: x86/mmu: Yield 
in TDU MMU iter even if no SPTES changed" could be dropped without 
making it any harder to backport those two.

It's not enabled by default and requires turning on a module parameter.

That also means that something like CKI will not notice if anything's 
wrong with these patches.  It also means that I could just shrug and 
hope that no one ever runs this code in 5.10 and 5.11 (which is actually 
the most likely case), but it is the process that is *just wrong*.

The big issue, and the one that you ignoredz every time we discuss this 
topic, is that this particular subset of 17 has AFAIK never been tested 
by anyone.

There's plenty of locking changes in here, one patch that you didn't 
backport has this in its commit message:

    This isn't technically a bug fix in the current code [...] but that
    is all very, very subtle, and will break at the slightest sneeze,

meaning that the locking in 5.10 and 5.11 was also less robust to 
changes elsewhere in the code.

Let's also talk about the process and the timing.  I got the "failed to 
apply" automated message last Friday and I was going to work on the 
backport today since yesterday was a holiday here.  I was *never* CCed 
on a post of this backport for maintainers to review; you guys 
*literally* took random subsets of patches from a feature that is new 
and in active development, and hoped that they worked on a past release.

I could be happy because you just provided me with a perfect example of 
why to use my employer's franken-kernel instead of upstream stable 
kernels... ;) but this is not how a world-class operating system is 
developed.  Who cares if a VM breaks or even if my laptop panics; but 
I'd seriously fear for my data if you applied the same attitude to XFS 
or ext4fs.

For now, please drop all 17 patches from 5.10 and 5.11.  I'll send a 
tested backport as soon as possible.

Paolo
