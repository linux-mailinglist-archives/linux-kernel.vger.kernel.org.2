Greetings, my dear

I am writing you base on your good profile. I am in search of a
property to buy in your country; I intended to come over to your
country for investment? I believe that I have to partner with a
citizen to be safe in investing in your country. My name is
Mrs.Janneth George, My late husband deals on Crude Oil with Federal
Government of Sudan and we have a personal Oil firm in Bentiu Oil zone
town and Upper Nile city.

What I have experience physically, I don't wish to experience it again
in my life due to the recent civil and Ethnic crises caused by our
President Mr. Salva Kiir and the rebel leader Mr. Riek Machar, I have
been Under United Nation refugee camp in Chad to save my life and that
of my little daughter.

I want to solicit for your partnership with trust to transfer and
invest the sum of (Ten million Five Hundred Thousand British Pounds
Sterling) deposited by my late husband to your country, because my
life is no longer safe in our country, since the rebels are looking
for the families of all the oil business men in the country to kill,
saying that they are the people that is milking the country dry.

Though, I do not know how you will feel to my proposal, but the truth
is that I sneaked into Chad our neighboring country where I am living
now as a refugee. I escaped with my little daughter when the rebels
bust into our house and killed my husband as one of the big oil
dealers in the country, ever since then, I have being on the run. I
left my country and move to Chad our neighboring country with the
little ceasefire we had, due to the face to face peace meeting accord
coordinated by the former US Secretary of State, and United Nations in
Ethiopia (Addis Ababa) between our President Mr. Salva Kiir and the
rebel leader Mr Riek Machar to stop this war.

I am presently in a camp in Cote d'Ivoire with my daughter.  I moved
out from our neighboring country Chad, because Chad is a poor country,
they are not able to take care of all the numerous refugees that came
out from our country.

Let me know if you are willing and capable of assisting us in getting
this fund transferred to your overseas bank account so that I can give
you more information on how you can get in contact with the bank where
my late husband deposited this fund when he was alive.

With love from

Mrs Janneth George
