Not related to this issue, but above two variables values doesn't looks
consistent.

Ok. So when you collected the dump this list was empty.

No point of doing this I guess, since the list anyway is empty.
What you may be seeing below is some garbage data.

I guess, since list is empty and you are seeing garbage hence counter value
of above node looks weird.

Not really. Since we anyway check busy variable too. Which is only set when the
bb_prealloc_list is actually not empty and have some busy pa's in it.

What may explain this scenario is.
1. That this writeback thread which is trying to write the dirty data, tries to
   free up some blocks but since the free_total < needed and busy == 1,
   -> so it released the group lock (ext4_unlock_group()) and make busy = 0.
   -> at this point there could be something running in parallel which may take
   the group lock and allocate those PAs which were released by this process.

2. writeback thread again comes and tries to check if the bb_prealloc_list is
   empty and it is not since some other thread again allocated something which
   this guys freed for itself.


Tell me -
1. How low was free space when you hit this issue.
2. How big was your FS? How many groups?
3. Is there some backgroud worker constantly running who is doing some
   allocations. Do you have a single cpu system?
   On this as soon writeback thread release the group lock, the other process
   gets schedule in, takes the lock and does some group preallocations from the
   same group from which wb thread freed some blocks.
   And so wb thread keeps looping.
4. Is this a real workload or is it some sort of simulated tests?

Maybe if you explain your above setup/environment better, that will help in
debugging on why this writeback thread was constantly running/enlessly-looping
for days
