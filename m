It does nothing, but perhaps crash the kernel.

Absolutely not!

Then it's just a reimplementation of trace_printk(). Which I refuse to
have.

Nothing should just dump to the main instance. Once we allow that, then
everyone will be dumping there and you will no longer be able to trace
anything because it will be filled with noise.

What is allowed is an event that acts like a trace_printk() but is an
event, which you can turn off (have default off), and even pick which
instance to go to.

I've been busy doing other things so I haven't been keeping up with
this thread (which I need to go back and read). Perhaps it was already
stated, but I don't know why you want that.

trace-cmd can read several instances (including the top level one) and
interleave them nicely, if that is what you are looking for. So can
KernelShark.
