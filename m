Subject: [PATCH 16/23] tty: reformat kernel-doc in n_tty.c
Date:   Fri, 26 Nov 2021 09:16:04 +0100
Message-Id: <20211126081611.11001-17-jslaby@suse.cz>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.34.0
In-Reply-To: <20211126081611.11001-1-jslaby@suse.cz>
References: <20211126081611.11001-1-jslaby@suse.cz>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Kernel-doc is a bit strict about some formatting. So fix these:
1) When there is a tab in comments, it thinks the line is a continuation
   one. So the description of the functions end up as descriptions of
   the last parameter described. Remove the tabs.

2) Remove newlines before parameters description and after the comments.
   This was not wrong per se, only inconsistent with the rest of the
   file.

3) Add periods to the end of sentences where appropriate.

4) Add "()" to function names and "%" to constants, so that they are
   properly highlighted.
