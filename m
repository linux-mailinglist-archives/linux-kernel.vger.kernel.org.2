Right. In theory we *could* maintain a separate pagetable for each IOMMU 
instance, but it would just lead to a load of complexity and overhead. 
For a map request, we'd have to do extra work to decide which table(s) 
need modifying, and duplicate all the work of the actual mapping if it's 
more than one. For an unmap request, we'd have no choice but to walk 
*all* the tables backing that domain to figure out which (if any) 
actually had it mapped in the first place.

Given that we already have distinct read and write permissions for 
mappings within a single table, there's not even any functional benefit 
that could be gained in this case (and in the more general case where 
the device might emit all kinds of transactions from all its interfaces 
you'd have to maintain identical mappings for all its IOMMUs anyway). 
Saving memory and code complexity by physically sharing one pagetable 
and not worrying about trying to do selective TLB maintenance is a 
bigger win than anything else could be.

Robin.
