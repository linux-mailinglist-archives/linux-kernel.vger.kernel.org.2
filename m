OK, I see. So the race in ext4_multi_mount_protect() goes like:

hostA				hostB

read_mmp_block()		read_mmp_block()
- sees EXT4_MMP_SEQ_CLEAN	- sees EXT4_MMP_SEQ_CLEAN
write_mmp_block()
wait_time == 0 -> no wait
read_mmp_block()
  - all OK, mount
				write_mmp_block()
				wait_time == 0 -> no wait
				read_mmp_block()
				  - all OK, mount

Do I get it right? Actually, if we passed seq we wrote in
ext4_multi_mount_protect() to kmmpd (probably in sb), then kmmpd would
notice the conflict on its first invocation but still that would be a bit
late because there would be a time window where hostA and hostB would be
both using the fs.

We could reduce the likelyhood of this race by always waiting in
ext4_multi_mount_protect() between write & read but I guess that is
undesirable as it would slow down all clean mounts. Ted?
