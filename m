Subject: [PATCH 1/3] arm64: perf: perf_callchain_user() compat support for clang/non-APCS-gcc-arm
Date:   Fri,  7 May 2021 13:55:11 -0700

Up until now the arm32-compat support in perf_callchain_user() made
the assumption that userspace code was compiled with the defunct APCS
(ARM Procedure Call Standard) calling convention. The existing code
also didn't support Thumb at all. Let's add a whole lot more
support. Specifically, we'll now support:

- clang-compiled Thumb userspace code w/ frame pointers.
- clang-compiled ARM userspace code w/ frame pointers.
- gcc-compiled ARM userspace code w/ frame pointers.

We'll also continue to keep supporting the APCS calling convention.

All of the above will be supported automagically. The important
first-order thing to care about is that ARM and Thumb use different
registers for storing the frame pointer. After that, we need to handle
the fact that the compilers don't agree on the format of a stack
frame. Luckily, we can differentiate between all of the different
supported conventions by relying on the simple fact that the stack is
non-executable and the PC is executable. All of the details of how
this is accomplished is described in the copius inline comments
introduced by this patch.

Please note that there is one compiler convention that is explicitly
_NOT_ supported by this patch, primary because it's believed to be
impossible to support without much fancier logic (like unwind
tables). The _UNSUPPORTED_ case is gcc-compiled Thumb userspace code
w/ frame pointers. The frame pointers in gcc-compiled Thumb userspace
code are largely useless for the purposes of crawling the stack. Given
that the primary purpose of frame pointers is to facilitate stack
crawling, it has been asserted that turning on frame pointers in
gcc-compiled Thumb userspace code is 100% useless. For some history,
you can see the gnu bugzilla [1].

Other notes:
- Presumably tracing code that intermixes ARM / Thumb wouldn't work
  amazingly well given the disagreement about which register stores
  the frame pointer. This patch would theoretically support such a
  situation if (and only if) the code creating the frame pointers was
  smart enough to create them correctly. The problem here is that the
  userspace code creating the stack frames would need to look at the
  mode of the caller (ARM vs. thumb) to figure out if it should store
  R11 or R7 as the old FP. I don't believe code does that.
- This patch likely supports intermixing APCS, clang-ARM, and gcc-ARM
  code, though that hasn't been tested.
- Given a limitation in clang, tracing clang code will omit the
  _callers_ of leaf functions. A future patch will attempt to improve
  the situation a little.

This patch has been tested with some toy code. Some details and
history may be able to be found in the Chrome OS bug system [2]. In
general, when testing, I used these commands:
  perf record  -e cycles:u -g -o "${OUT}" -- "${PROG"}
  perf report -i "${OUT}" -g flat
