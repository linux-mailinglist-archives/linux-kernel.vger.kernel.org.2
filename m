Good point. But looks like kmalloc* caches are extempt from all merging in
create_boot_cache() via

	s->refcount = -1;       /* Exempt from merging for now */

It wouldn't hurt though to create the kmalloc-cg-* caches with SLAB_ACCOUNT flag
to prevent accidental merging in case the above is ever removed. It would also
better reflect reality, and ensure that the array is allocated immediately with
the page, AFAICS.
