Could you be more specific? Also how would this be any different from
similar failures for an oom victim? Except that the later is less likely
so (as already mentioend) any potential bugs would be just lurking there
for a longer time.

Do you have any specific example?

I do not think we want to shape the vmalloc bahavior based on
printk/console behavior.

This doesn't make much sense to me TBH. It doesn't address the very
problem you are describing in the changelog.
