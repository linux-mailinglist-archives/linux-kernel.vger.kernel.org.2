Sure, and that's what I tried to do with the MDS patch in [1].  I'm not
confident that's safe enough, although I _think_ the case you describe:

 client A                             client B
                                      mkdir XYZ
 lookup inode XYZ
 setxattr (set layout)                encrypt XYZ

should be protected with the right caps + MDS locks.  But I'll go look
closer because I *know* I am still missing something.
