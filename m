Yes some sort of rate limiting should help. My understanding has been
that this is the main purpose of the even counting threshold. The code
as we have doesn't seem to work properly so there are two ways, either
tune the existing threshold or replace it by something else. Having both
a force update and non-functional threshold is not a great outcome.

What was the underlying reason? Higher order allocations?
