I'm going to have to revert this change, since it breaks online
resizing for bigalloc file system.  The issue is that
ext4_resize_begin() is called from *three* places: for
EXT4_IOC_GROUP_ADD, EXT4_IOC_GROUP_EXTEND, and EXT4_IOC_RESIZE_FS.
The first two ioctls are used for the "old-style" online resize, and
bigalloc is not supported for those two ioctls.  However, it *is*
supposed to work for EXT4_IOC_RESIZE_FS.

Unfortunately, this just caused some tests to be skipped (assuming
that this was an old kernel that didn't support this feature) and I
didn't notice it right away.
