I guess you mean this lacks an explanation as to why this only applies
to ITRACE and not others? See below.

Ok I suppose you mean CONFIG_SECURITY_LOCKDOWN_LSM? But I don't see
how this new config has to depend on that? This can work independently
whether complete lockdown is enforced or not since it applies to only
hardware instruction tracing. Ideally this depends on several hardware
tracing configs such as ETMs and others but we don't need them because
we are already exposing PERF_PMU_CAP_ITRACE check in the events core.

Here ITRACE is not just instruction trace, it is meant for hardware 
assisted
instruction trace such as Intel PT, Intel BTS, ARM coresight etc. These 
provide
much more capabilities than normal instruction tracing whether its 
kernel level
or userspace. More specifically, these provide more accurate branch 
trace like
Intel PT LBR (Last Branch Record), Intel BTS(Branch Trace Store) which 
can be
used to decode the program flow more accurately with timestamps in real 
time
than other PMUs. Also there is cycle accurate tracing which can 
theoretically
be used for some speculative execution based attacks. Which other kernel 
level
PMUs can be used to get a full branch trace that is not locked down? If 
there
is one, then this should probably be applied to it as well.

Thanks,
Sai
