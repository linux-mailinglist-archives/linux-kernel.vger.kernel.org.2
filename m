I see. Well that's unfortunate if checking zone->nr_isolate_pageblock is not
sufficient, as it was supposed to be :(
But I don't think the check_migratetype_isolated() check was helping in such
scenario as it was, anyway.

It's testing this:

+       if (unlikely(has_isolate_pageblock(zone) ||
+               is_migrate_isolate(migratetype))) {

In the context of free_one_page(), the 'migratetype' variable holds a value
that's read from pageblock in one of the callers of free_one_page():

migratetype = get_pcppage_migratetype(page);

and because it's read outside of zone lock, it might be a MIGRATE_ISOLATE even
though after we obtain the zone lock, we might find out it's not anymore. This
is explained in commit ad53f92eb416 ("mm/page_alloc: fix incorrect isolation
behavior by rechecking migratetype") as scenario 1.

However, in the context of free_pcppages_bulk(), the migratetype we are checking
in check_migratetype_isolated() is this one:

int mt = get_pcppage_migratetype(page);

That was the one determined while adding the page to pcplist, and is stored in
the struct page and we know it's not MIGRATE_ISOLATE otherwise the page would
not go to pcplist. But by rechecking this stored value, we would not be finding
the case where the underlying pageblock's migratetype would change to
MIGRATE_ISOLATE, anyway...
