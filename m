Hmm. So you have say, 5 reads stuck in the RW semaphore while preempted
be medium tasks and high-prio writer is then stuck on semaphore, waiting
for the MED tasks to finish so the low-prio threads can leave the
criticial section?

I don't think it will help. Based on what you wrote above it appears
that the problem is that the readers are preempted and are not leaving
the critical section soon enough.

How many CPUs do you have? Maybe using a rtmutex here and allowing only
one reader at a time isn't that bad in your case. With one CPU for
instance, there isn't much space for multiple readers I guess.
