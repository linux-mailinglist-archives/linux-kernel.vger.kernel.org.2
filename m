For the record: I basically took Michael's description, the one which you
said you prefer, with some minor changes.

This is one of the changes, which renders this a paraphrase and not a
quote. Michael didn't use quotation marks so I was not sure it is was
a word by word quote anyway. It was. But the spec depends on "During this
step" which does not make any sense without the context. That is why I made
the end of step explicit.

I think we are fine without quotation marks. Those who care can read the
spec.

Yes. Was like this in the original. Will change

How about the following?

The regressions affect the VIRTIO_NET_F_MTU feature of virtio-net and the
VIRTIO_BLK_F_BLK_SIZE feature of virtio-blk for BE guests when virtio
1.0 is used on both sides. The latter renders virtio-blk unusable with
DASD backing, because things simply don't work with the default.

We have that already, don't we. The sentence that starts with "In
particular". The regression description should reinforce that
sufficiently IMHO.

Can do, but I would rather omit the (BE) at the end. All the conditions
are necessary:
* have validate callback
* device offered VERSION_1
* virtio legacy is be

Can do.

Thanks for having a look. If you are fine with the proposed solution
please tell me, so I can send out a v2.

If not let us work towards an acceptable solution.
