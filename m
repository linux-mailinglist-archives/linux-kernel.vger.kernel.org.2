Right, unmapping tables works out as a bit of a compromise for 
non-strict mode - we don't use a freelist to defer the freeing of 
pagetable pages, so we rely on making non-leaf invalidations 
synchronously to knock out walk caches which may be pointing to the page 
beforte we free it. We might actually be able to get away without that 
for non-strict unmaps, since partial walks pointing at freed memory 
probably aren't too much more hazardous than the equivalent leaf TLB 
entries while the IOVA region is held in the flush queue, but it 
certainly does matter for maps when we're knocking out a (presumably 
empty) table entry to put down a new block whose IOVA will be 
immediately live.

Robin.
