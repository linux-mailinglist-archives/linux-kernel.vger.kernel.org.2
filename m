Why is none of this information in the changelog text?  How are we
supposed to know this?  And is this 400msec out of 10 seconds or
something else?  Also, this sounds like your "little" cpus are really
bad, you might want to look into fixing them first :)

But if you really want to make this go faster, do not deferr your probe!
Why not fix that problem in your drivers instead?

Can you prove that it is not important?  I know lots of gyrations are
done in some busses to keep probe happening on the same CPU for very
good reasons.  Changing that should not be done lightly as you will
break this.
