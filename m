Matthew is being pretty clear here: we shouldn't be permitting
userspace to get a writeable fd for a thp-backed file.

Why are we permitting the DSO to be opened writeably?  If there's a
legitimate case for doing this then presumably "mm, thp: relax the
VM_DENYWRITE constraint on file-backed THPs: should be fixed or
reverted.

If there is no legitimate use case for returning a writeable fd for a
thp-backed file then we should fail such an attempt at open().  This
approach has back-compatibility issues which need to be thought about. 
Perhaps we should permit the open-writeably attempt to appear to
succeed, but to really return a read-only fd?
