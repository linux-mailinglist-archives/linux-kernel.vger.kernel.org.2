I believe so, perf_event_open syscall uses this approach. I think
sharing among processes would only be a problem if the file_operations
methods assumed some synchronization. I don't see how this would be
different than a fork inheriting a pre-existing FD.

Yep, agree. It sounds like taking an index'd approach as you first
suggested is worth the complexity. I want to make sure you and Steven
agree before attempting.
