I think this is needed to ensure this binding is not enforced against
arm,primecell compatible nodes which are not featuring the
arm,pl353-smc-r2p1 compatible.

That is precisely what I try to match and I think it works. Perhaps
this version is easier to extend when a new compatible comes in.
However, I am fine using an alternative formula, like below if you
think it's better:

compatible:
  items:
    - const: arm,pl353-smc-r2p1
    - const: arm,primecell

I don't think it is that obvious because there are actually 4 areas
and, because of the yaml language, we only describe one in the reg
property while the others and defined in the ranges property, but
that's fine by me, I'll drop the description and stick to a
maxItems entry.

The SMC has two clock domains referred as aclk and mclk. In the TRM,
aclk is described as "Clock for the AXI domain". The AXI interface is
used to trigger CMD/ADDR/DATA cycles on the memory bus. There is also
an APB interface used to reach the SMC registers. I *think* that
both APB and AXI domains are fed by the same apb_pclk source but I
might be wrong. Hence memclk would just feed the memory bus that bonds
the memory device (eg. the NAND flash) to the host controller.

This is my current understanding but if you think it works differently
I'm all ears because this part is not 100% clear to me.

I think Rob even now prefers to drop the ^.* prefix, but you're right on
the two other points so I'll stick to:

  "@[0-3],[a-f0-9]+$"
