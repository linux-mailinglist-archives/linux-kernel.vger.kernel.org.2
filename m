I am fine with the change, I am just not satisfied with the
justification. It is not really clear what the intention is except that
Linus wanted it. I have already asked Vasily to provide more
explanation. E.g. this part really begs for clarification
"
This object can consume up to 2 pages, syscall is sleeping one,
size and duration can be controlled by user, and this allocation
can be repeated by many thread at the same time.
"

It sounds like a problem, except it is not because? A worst case
scenario evaluation would be beneficial for example

Thanks!
