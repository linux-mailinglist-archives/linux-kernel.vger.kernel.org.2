This is v3 of the series enabling ARMv8.6 support for timer subsystem,
and was prompted by a discussion with Oliver around the fact that an
ARMv8.6 implementation must have a 1GHz counter, which leads to a
number of things to break in the timer code:

- the counter rollover can come pretty quickly as we only advertise a
  56bit counter,
- the maximum timer delta can be remarkably small, as we use the
  countdown interface which is limited to 32bit...

Thankfully, there is a way out: we can compute the minimal width of
the counter based on the guarantees that the architecture gives us,
and we can use the 64bit comparator interface instead of the countdown
to program the timer.

Finally, we start making use of the ARMv8.6 ECV features by switching
accesses to the counters to a self-synchronising register, removing
the need for an ISB. Hopefully, implementations will *not* just stick
an invisible ISB there...

A side effect of the switch to CVAL is that XGene-1 breaks. I have
added a workaround to keep it alive.

I have added Oliver's original patch[0] to the series and tweaked a
couple of things. Blame me if I broke anything.

The whole things has been tested on Juno (sysreg + MMIO timers),
XGene-1 (broken sysreg timers), FVP (FEAT_ECV, CNT*CTSS_EL0).

* From v2 [2]:
  - New patch adding a HWCAP (ECV) allowing userspace to probe for
    the presence of CNTVSS_EL0.

* From v1 [1]:
  - New patch adding a bunch of BUILD_BUG()s for register accesses we
    don't expect. This makes subsequent patches much simpler.
  - New patch moving the ISBs for workaround in a way that makes
    more sense for the self-synchronising accessors.
  - Rework the XGene-1 workaround to rely solely on MIDR.
  - Split the CNTVCTSS trap handling in its own patch.
  - Rebased on 5.15-rc2
  - Collected RBs, with thanks.
