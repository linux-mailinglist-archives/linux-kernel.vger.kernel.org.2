Of course we need to be careful to not break anything. But having some
clever fallback methods could work.

For example, for an SD/SDIO card slot it shouldn't matter if
MMC_CAP_8_BIT_DATA gets set. But I didn't look that closely if that
could be an option.

Yeah, the timing thingy looks harder to get rid of for the k3 variant.

Although, if we could limit the alias parsing to the k3 variant, that
would still be a nice cleanup and improvement.

As a next step we could look at introducing some new DT properties for
k3, to specify the timing thingy - and then make the mshc alias
deprecated.

Great.

Right. I will try to get some time to help clean this up.
