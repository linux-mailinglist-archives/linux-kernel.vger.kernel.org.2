At the moment, I will comment on the bindings first and my idea on how 
to proceed.
The bindings mentioned here: 
https://lore.kernel.org/dri-devel/20210521124946.3617862-3-vkoul@kernel.org/ 
seem to be just
taken directly from downstream which was not the plan.

I think all of these should be part of the generic panel bindings as 
none of these are QC specific:

@@ -188,6 +195,14 @@ Example:
  		qcom,master-dsi;
  		qcom,sync-dual-dsi;

+		qcom,mdss-dsc-enabled;
+		qcom,mdss-slice-height = <16>;
+		qcom,mdss-slice-width = <540>;
+		qcom,mdss-slice-per-pkt = <1>;
+		qcom,mdss-bit-per-component = <8>;
+		qcom,mdss-bit-per-pixel = <8>;
+		qcom,mdss-block-prediction-enable;
+

How about having a panel-dsc.yaml which will have these properties and 
have a panel-dsc node to have this information?

I would like to hear the feedback on this proposal then the series can 
be reworked.

Thanks
