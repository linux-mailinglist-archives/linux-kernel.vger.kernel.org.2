This patch means that the Quadra 630/580 config will work the same as the 
Powerbook 190 config. Please see commit 50c5feeea0af ("ide/macide: Convert 
Mac IDE driver to platform driver") for some background.

This patch also means that the kernel/drivers/ide/macide.ko driver module 
will disappear completely. The module that will replace it is up to you.

If you enable CONFIG_IDE and CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PLATFORM, Quadras and 
Powerbooks will use the kernel/drivers/ide/ide_platform.ko module.

If you enable CONFIG_ATA and CONFIG_PATA_PLATFORM, Quadras and
Powerbooks will use the kernel/drivers/ata/pata_platform.ko module.

(If you enable all of the above, you may need to use a blacklist to ensure 
that the preferred driver module gets loaded.)

Was macide the only IDE driver in Debian/m68k kernels without a libata 
alternative? If so, this patch would allow you to finally drop CONFIG_IDE.
