That's not correct. We integrated 5 separate devices into s2mps11
regulator driver, around 7 devices into a MFD driver, 4 devices into RTC
driver and 4 devices into clock driver.

One FRC was also in previous MCT, wasn't it? It supported 4 comparators,
but FRC was only one.

Thanks, I got it from the driver. Linux supports handling such
differences, including differences in register map. In the same time
just quick look at the code shows several re-used functions.

We handle different register layouts without big issue. There are
several drivers showing this example, for example mentioned earlier
Samsung PMIC drivers. 4 different register layouts for RTC driver in one
driver and you mention here that two is some big difference?

The way of operating could be indeed a trouble but looking at the code
it is actually very, very similar.

If everyone added a new driver to avoid integrating with existing code,
we would have huge kernel with thousands of duplicated solutions. The
kernel also would be unmaintained.

Such arguments were brought before several times - "I don't want to
integrating with existing code", "My use case is different", "I would
need to test the other cases", "It's complicated for me".

Instead of pushing a new vendor driver you should integrate it with
existing code.

Krzysztof
