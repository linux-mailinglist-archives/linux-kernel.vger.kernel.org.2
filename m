I didn't add any as there is no commit that is clearly introducing the
problem. This patch fixes a behavior of the chip, which is there by
design by causes problems in some use cases.

If a Fixes tag is required than I guess it should be the commit adding
support for the 5P49V6965, which is the only supported variant of VC[56]
having having the problematic behavior _and_ the reserved register bits
to prevent it. However I hardly could blame the author of that code for
such a "peculiar" chip behaviour. Do you still want me to add such a tag?
