Right. In my scenario, the clock is needed for MMIO access to a low-speed
peripheral. I don't care what the clock rate is as long as it keeps running.

When writing the patch, I initially protected the rate as well, but that had the
unintended effect of protecting the rate of every ancestor clock. Maybe you need
rate protection for a "hands off, kernel" type of clock? If so, ignoring the
clock at probe time does not work, because the kernel does not know to protect
its parent rate.

So it sounds like the Qualcomm case is less about "don't touch the clock output"
as it is "don't touch the clock control registers".

Yes, you can set additional flags in __clk_protect() to achieve that:
CLK_SET_RATE_GATE, CLK_SET_PARENT_GATE. This is a bit of a trick; it relies on
CLK_IS_CRITICAL preventing the clock from ever being gated.

Cheers,
Samuel
