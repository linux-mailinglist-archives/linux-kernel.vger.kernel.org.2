On this stage task really dies and mostly releases taken resources.
It can allocate though, and this allocation can reach memcg limit due to the activity
of parallel memcg threads.

Noting bad should happen if we reject this allocation,
because the same thing can happen in non-memcg case too.
However I doubt misuse is possible here and we have possibility to allow graceful shutdown here.

In other words: we are not obliged to allow such allocations, but we CAN do it because
we hope that it is safe and cannot be misused.
