Hi Chunguang,

I find this contribution very interesting.  Anyway, given the
relevance of such a contribution, I'd like to hear from relevant
people (Jens, Tejun, ...?), before revising individual patches.

Yet I already have a general question.  How does this mechanism comply
with per-process ioprios and ioprio classes?  For example, what
happens if a process belongs to BE-class group according to your
mechanism, but to a RT class according to its ioprio?  Does the
pre-group class dominate the per-process class?  Is all clean and
predictable?

Wouldn't it be nicer to have acronyms for classes (RT, BE, IDLE),
instead of numbers?

Thank you very much for this improvement proposal,
Paolo
