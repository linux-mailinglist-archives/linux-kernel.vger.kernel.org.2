This part of the changelog tried to explain that part IIRC
"
    We can get rid of {get,put}_online_cpus, fortunately.  We do not have to
    be worried about races with memory hotplug because drain_local_stock,
    which is called from both the WQ draining and the memory hotplug
    contexts, is always operating on the local cpu stock with IRQs disabled.
"

Now I have to admit I do not remember all the details and from a quick
look the memory hotplug doesn't seem to be draining memcg pcp stock.
Maybe this has been removed since then. The only stock draining outside
of the memcg code seems to be memcg_hotplug_cpu_dead callback. That
would indicate that I really meant the cpu hotplug here indeed.
