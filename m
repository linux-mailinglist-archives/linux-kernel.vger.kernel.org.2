Yes, we should be able to support eDP + DP concurrently on both sc7280
and sc8180x. Some of the changes we will be posting in the coming weeks
should add support for it. Till then, as we spoke on IRC, since your 
changes
dont break existing DP functionality, will continue reviewing rest of 
the changes.
