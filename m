We can reach obj_cgroup_charge_pages() for example via

do_user_addr_fault
handle_mm_fault
__handle_mm_fault
p4d_alloc
__p4d_alloc
p4d_alloc_one
get_zeroed_page
__get_free_pages
alloc_pages
__alloc_pages
__memcg_kmem_charge_page
obj_cgroup_charge_pages

Here we call try_charge_memcg() that return success and approve the allocation,
however then we hit into kmem limit and fail the allocation.

If required I can try to search how try_charge_memcg() can reject page allocation 
of non-dying task too.

I like this idea, however it may be not enough, at least in scenario described above.

Thank you, I'll read this discussion.
