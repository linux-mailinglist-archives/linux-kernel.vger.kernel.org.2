It's a fair question and it was my first approach before I hit problems.
Thinking again this morning, I remembered that another problem I hit was
patterns like this

        local_lock_irqsave(&pagesets.lock, flags);
        pcp = per_cpu_ptr(zone->per_cpu_pageset, cpu);

turning into

	cpu = get_cpu();
        pcp = per_cpu_ptr(zone->per_cpu_pageset, cpu);
        local_lock_irqsave(&pcp->lock, flags);

That has its own problems if zone->lock was acquired within the
local_lock_irqsave section (Section "spinlock_t and rwlock_t" in
Documentation/locking/locktypes.rst) so it has to turn into

	migrate_disable();
	pcp = this_cpu_ptr(zone->per_cpu_pageset);
        local_lock_irqsave(&pcp->lock, flags);

I did not want to start adding migrate_disable() in multiple places like
this because I'm guessing that new users of migrate_disable() need strong
justification and adding such code in page_alloc.c might cause cargo-cult
copy&paste in the future. Maybe it could be addressed with a helper like
this_cpu_local_lock or this_cpu_local_lock_irq but that means in some
cases that the PCP structure is looked up twice with patterns like this one

        local_lock_irqsave(&pagesets.lock, flags);
        free_unref_page_commit(page, pfn, migratetype);
        local_unlock_irqrestore(&pagesets.lock, flags);

To get around multiple lookups the helper becomes something that disables
migration, looks up the PCP structure, locks it and returns it with
pcp then passed around as appropriate. Not sure what I would call that
helper :P

In the end I just gave up and kept it simple as there is no benefit to
!PREEMPT_RT which just disables IRQs. Maybe it'll be worth considering when
PREEMPT_RT is upstream and can be enabled. The series was functionally
tested on the PREEMPT_RT tree by reverting the page_alloc.c patch and
applies this series and all of its prerequisites on top.
