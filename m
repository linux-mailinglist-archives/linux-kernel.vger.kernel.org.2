Applied with the following commit description:

    ext4: always panic when errors=panic is specified
    
    Before commit 014c9caa29d3 ("ext4: make ext4_abort() use
    __ext4_error()"), the following series of commands would trigger a
    panic:
    
    1. mount /dev/sda -o ro,errors=panic test
    2. mount /dev/sda -o remount,abort test
    
    After commit 014c9caa29d3, remounting a file system using the test
    mount option "abort" will no longer trigger a panic.  This commit will
    restore the behaviour immediately before commit 014c9caa29d3.
    (However, note that the Linux kernel's behavior has not been
    consistent; some previous kernel versions, including 5.4 and 4.19
    similarly did not panic after using the mount option "abort".)
    
    This also makes a change to long-standing behaviour; namely, the
    following series commands will now cause a panic, when previously it
    did not:
    
    1. mount /dev/sda -o ro,errors=panic test
    2. echo test > /sys/fs/ext4/sda/trigger_fs_error
    
    However, this makes ext4's behaviour much more consistent, so this is
    a good thing.
    
    Fixes: 014c9caa29d3 ("ext4: make ext4_abort() use __ext4_error()")
