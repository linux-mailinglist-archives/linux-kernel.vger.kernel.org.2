On this faith full recommendations, I want you to know that during the
last UN meetings held at Africa ,it was alarmed so much by the rest of
the world in the meetings on the lost of funds by various foreigners
to the scams artists operating in syndicates all over the world today,
in other to retain the good image of the country, the president UN is

the corrupt and inefficient banking systems in Africa, the payments
are to be wired via direct transfer, online banking transfer or ATM
