Completely agree with Jason. Filling in the CPU page tables is 
relatively cheap if you fill in a large continuous range.

In other words filling in 1GiB of a linear range is *much* less overhead 
than filling in 1<<18 4KiB faults.

I would say that this is always preferable even if the CPU only wants to 
update a single byte.

Oh, yes please!

We easily have 16GiB of VRAM which is linear mapped into the kernel 
space for each GPU instance.

Doing that with 1GiB mapping instead of 4KiB would be quite a win.

Christian.
