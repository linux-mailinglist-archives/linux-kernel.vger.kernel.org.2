I already tested it on MSM8916 and this is only partially true. :)

It looks like the RPM_DYNAMIC_ADDR was added together with some firmware
update. I tested on several devices and on most of them RPM_DYNAMIC_ADDR
reads 0xdba0 (that is, there are no changes necessary in the driver).

So far I have only found one single device with fairly old firmware
where RPM_DYNAMIC_ADDR reads 0x0.

But yeah, I guess we might need the fixed offset anyway at some point
for even older targets than MSM8916, so it is probably safer to add it
like this. Will investigate it some more once your patch is accepted.

Almost, it's "vmin" and "xosd" ("XO Shutdown" I guess) on MSM8916. :)
