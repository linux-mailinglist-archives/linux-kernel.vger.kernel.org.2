As the maintainer of tracefs, why am I not Cc'd on that thread :-(

I'll have to look at that thread later (no time now).

What we are looking at there is to pass the dynamic debug descriptor to the
trace event filtering logic, where you could filter on information passed
to it. For example, on a specific file if a trace event is called by
several different files or modules.
