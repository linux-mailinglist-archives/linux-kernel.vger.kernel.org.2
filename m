Yep, since depending on the init function it can discover and stuff in
a wild variety of functions.

It is not. The target is determined once, at boot time, depending on the
hardware, it then never changes. The static_call() results in a direct
call to that function.

I know, and CFI works for cold_function.

static_call_update() is a macro and has compile time signature checks,
the actual function is __static_call_update() and someone can go add
extra validation in there if they so desire.

I did have this patch:

  https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20210904105529.GA5106@worktop.programming.kicks-ass.net

but I never did get around to finishing it. Although looking at it now,
I suppose static_call_seal() might be a better name.

And you're worried about __static_call_update() over text_poke_bp()
because?

Exactly, so the extra jump serves no purpose and needs to go. Doubly so
because people are looking at static_call() to undo some of the
performance damage introduced by CFI :-)

I've mentioned static_call like a hundred times in these CFI threads..
if you want to do CFI on them, go ahead. I'm just not sure the C type
system is up for that, you'll have to somehow frob the signature symbol
into __static_call_update(), something like __builtin_type_symbol().

That sounds like a ton of painful ugly.
