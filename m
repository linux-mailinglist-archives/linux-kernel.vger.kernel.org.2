Right, but per the upstream implementation, enabling MDSS_GDSC could in
itself fail, because unless something else has driven up the performance
state the enable that trickles up won't actually turn on the supply.

Right, but it does so as part of its clock scaling, so this makes
perfect sense to me.

In rpmhpd_power_on() and rpmhpd_set_performance_state() we pass the
index of the entry in pd->levels[] that we want, but in
rpmhpd_power_off() we pass the value of pd->levels[0].

So I would suggest dropping the if (pd->corner) and doing:

  rpmhpd_aggregate_corner(pd, max(pd->corner, 1));

And it seems both rb3 and rb5 still boots with this change (but I need
to do some more testing to know for sure).

I agree.

Looking at other power-domains (e.g. gdsc and rpmpd) enabling the
power-domain means it is no longer off and if you need some specific
performance state you have to vote for that.

So I'm also interested in hearing if there's any reasoning behind how
this was written.
