to the split_page_memcg() addition etc, but a doubt just hit me on the
original e320d3012d25 ("mm/page_alloc.c: fix freeing non-compound pages"):
see comment below.

The put_page_testzero() has released our reference to the first
subpage of page: it's now under the control of the racing speculative
lookup.  So it seems to me unsafe to be checking PageHead(page) here:
if it was actually a compound page, PageHead might already be cleared
by now, and we doubly free its tail pages below?  I think we need to
use a "bool compound = PageHead(page)" on entry to __free_pages().

Or alternatively, it's wrong to call __free_pages() on a compound
page anyway, so we should not check PageHead at all, except in a
WARN_ON_ONCE(PageCompound(page)) at the start?

And would it be wrong to fix that too in this patch?
Though it ought then to be backported to 5.10 stable.
