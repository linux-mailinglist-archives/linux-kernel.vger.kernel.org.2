Do the opp-levels in DTS represent how the hardware behaves? If so then it does just
appear to be that whatever is responsible for scaling the GX rail voltage
has no time limits and will attempt to switch the regulator between min/max
voltage as often as we tell it to which is probably not something the hardware expected.
