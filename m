I think these attributes are quite useful information to have available so
I'd go actually doing sysfs attributes and create
Documentation/ABI/stable/sysfs-driver-sgx to document them.

Given that they would go then to the sysfs directory of the driver, then
probably the legit names for the attributes ought to be:

- nr_all_epc_pages
- nr_free_epc_pages

What do you think?

PS. One useful case that I forgot to mention is that I use these to give
idea what I gave EPC size in the BIOS. Now my EPC is set to 32 MB, and
these report 20 MB of EPC pages. It's because other metadata (e.g. EPCM
containing page attributes) is also stored in this area.
