Lo, this is your Linux kernel regression tracker speaking. I have this
regression on the radar of regzbot, my Linux regression tracking bot:
https://linux-regtracking.leemhuis.info/regzbot/regression/4970a940-211b-25d6-edab-21a815313954@protonmail.com/

Has any progress been made since below mail? If not: how can we get the
ball rolling again and get this regression fixed?

Ciao, Thorsten

P.S.: I have no personal interest in this issue. Hence, feel free to
exclude me on further messages in this thread after the first reply, as
I'm only posting this mail to hopefully get a status update and things
rolling again.
