Right now, yes, we treat USB devices as "possibly malicious".  We do not
do so for PCI devices yet.  If we want to do that, then we need to do a
lot of work, not just "this one call in this one driver" type of thing
as there are much bigger issues involved here.

If you wish to take on this work, as you feel PCI devices should be
treated this way, please do so!  But start in the PCI core at the very
least, before worrying about the thousands of individual drivers.

good luck!
