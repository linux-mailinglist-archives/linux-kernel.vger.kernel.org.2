multi_v7_defconfig and ARMv8's defconfig are bloated monoliths which
provide limited flexibility.  Good for testing and messing around -
not much good for real products.

The use-case is GKI.  A realistic middle-ground between fully open
source and real-world usage of the Linux kernel in a competitive
technical arena.  GKI aims to be as close to Mainline as possible,
whilst allowing hardware vendors to supply their own software
containing their perceived competitive edge and/or supporting
not-yet-released hardware platforms.

If you end up over-constraining the ability to configure the kernel in
useful/meaningful ways, that makes one of the main (best intention)
aims of GKI, (i.e. to have an upstream first ethos in order to be as
close to upstream as possible) much more difficult.

I put in a lot of effort to ensure GKI doesn't end up as just another
fork of the Linux kernel.  So far, so good, but flexibility and
understanding is key.

I can go with that.

Hopefully my replies have helped somewhat.

Happy to discuss further if required.

If all else fails, feel free to ping me on IRC (lag).
