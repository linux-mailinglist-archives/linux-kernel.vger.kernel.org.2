Hmm, ok that confirms Bjorns suspicion and explains how it came to be.
I can certainly sent a patch for that. This would then leave only the
existing use in s390 which I added because of a dead lock prevention
and explained here:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/87d15d5eead35c9eaa667958d057cf4a81a8bf13.camel@linux.ibm.com/

Plus the need to use it in the recovery code of this series. I think in
the EEH code the need for a similar check is alleviated by the checks
in the beginning of
arch/powerpc/kernel/eeh_driver.c:eeh_handle_normal_event() especially
eeh_slot_presence_check() which checks presence via the hotplug slot.
I guess we could use our own state tracking in a similar way but felt
like pci_dev_is_added() is the more logical choice.

I agree that sounds reasonable.
