Yes we can filter these symbols out when adding module symbols to the kallsyms
list. I will send another patch that modifies module.c to ignore '$' symbols
when loading module.

I think it's worth applying this patch in the sense that perf userspace tool
can be used on all 5.x kernels, and people don't have to update the kernel
to fix it.
