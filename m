Yes this was more more or less clear (still would have been nicer to be
explicit). But you still haven't replied to my question I believe. I
assume you rely on refill_stock doing draining but how does this address
the problem? Is it sufficient to do wakeups in the batched way?

So does it really help to do the inlining?
