What is "tpm chip driver"? Please just refer to the exact thing
(e.g. tpm_tis_spi is the one you should refer to in your case).

> 3. perform a write() to /dev/tpmrm

Just a nit: Use capital letter as the first letter in sentences.

If I do "rmmod tpm_tis" the device is gone.

I guess this is happening with tpm_tis_spi. Unfortunately I don't have
anything available that would use it.

I did testing with tpm_tis but so far no success reproducing.

Generally you don't write in person to a commit message. This not an
email in that sense. You should write in imperative form.

Copy pasting this is probably unnecessary.

OK, what you really should explain in the commit message is:

1. Why this function *is not* called.
2. What your fix does to make things better.

If it did not work, it works now :-) So any fix would not be required.
Just making a point here.

You should not need this explanation to explain refcount mismatch. Also
past tense should not be used.

I appreciate the time taken to write all this but you should just explain
what you do and why. Let's just say this explanation is very obfuscted and
hard to follow.

If the fix makes sense a Cc stable is also required.

Hope this feedback helps to improve. You really need to rewrite the whole
commit message. I wonder who could try to reproduce this. With a quick
skim I get the issue.

Also you don't have James Bottomley in the CC list of the patch who is
the author of the original commit. Please sort that out too...
