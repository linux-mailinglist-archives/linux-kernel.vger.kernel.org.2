Also for hugetlb migration when memory compaction, we've already counted the number of pages for a hugetlb into cc->nr_migratepages, if the hugetlb migration failed, the trace stat of compaction will be confusing if we return the number of hugetlb.

I am not sure if we should change the manpage, since the THP already did, but I can send a patch to update the manpage if you think this is still necessary. Thanks.

IMO it will break the usage in other places if we change the rc value of 
migrate_pages(), for example, the page migration when doing memory 
compaction as I said before, which will expect the number of normal 
pages. Meanwhile the THP page can be split into normal pages during 
migration, so it will not be consistent if we return the number of THP.

Changing the return value of migrate_pages() will make things more 
complicated, and I am not sure whether it is worth doing. Any 
suggestion? Thanks.
