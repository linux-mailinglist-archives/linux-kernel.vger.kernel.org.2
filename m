Ah yes, you misunderstand. The KOBJ_NS_TYPE_* tags are namespace tags.
So KOBJ_NS_TYPE_NET is a network namespace tag. So KOBJ_NS_TYPE_USER is
a user namespace tag not a completely new namespace. The idea very
roughly being that devices such as loop devices are ultimately filtered
by user namespace which is taken from the s_user_ns the loopfs instance
is mounted in. We should compare notes.
