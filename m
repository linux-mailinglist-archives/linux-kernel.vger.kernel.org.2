All those reasons should be a part of the changelog.

I am not sure these are sufficient justifications but that is something
to discuss. And hence it should be a part of the changelog.

You should quantify that and argue why that overhead cannot be further
reduced without config/boot time knobs.

I am all for improving the code. Is it possible to do it by other means?
E.g. reduce a potential overhead when there no events registered?
