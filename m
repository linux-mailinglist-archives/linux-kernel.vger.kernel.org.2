I would argue that the DRBGs don't get immediately reseeded before this
patch, because there's no guarantee on when the drbg_async_seed() work
eventually gets to run.

I.e. something like the following would be possible:

						wait_for_random_bytes() {
  crng_reseed() {
    crng_init =3D 2;
    process_random_ready_list() {
      drbg_schedule_async_seed();
    }
    wake_up_interruptible(&crng_init_wait);
  }
						}
						crypto_rng_generate() {
						  drbg_generate();
						}
  drbg_async_seed(); /* <-- too late */


The wait_for_random_bytes() has been added only for demonstration
purposes here, right now there aren't any DRBG users invoking it,
AFAICT. Note that even in the presence of a hypothetical
wait_for_random_bytes() barrier, it would still be possible for a
subsequent drbg_generate() to run on a not yet reseeded DRBG.

After this patch OTOH, the drbg_generate() would invoke a reseed by
itself once it observes the crng_init =3D=3D 2, i.e. once
rng_is_initialized() flips to true.

So yes, you're right, the DRBGs don't get reseeded immediately once
get_random_bytes() becomes ready, but more in a "lazy fashion" when
accessed the next time. However, it's now guaranteed that
drbg_generate() won't operate on a not yet updated DRBG state when
rng_is_initialized() is true (at function entry).

Assuming that by "run" you mean drbg_generate(), then no, I don't think
so. Or at least that has not been my intention and would be a bug in the
patch. For reference, I'll mark the spot in the quoted code below which
is supposed to make drbg_generate() reseed the DRGB once
rng_is_initialized() has flipped to true.

Darn, no. I'll wait a few more days for further review and send a v2
with this fixed up.

As mentioned above, this here is the change that is supposed to make
drbg_generate() reseed itself once rng_is_initialized() has flipped to
true.

Thanks,
