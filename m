We absolutely could. However, the sixpence question (yes, that's the
Brexit effect for you) is "what do you do with exceptions that are
neither UNDEF now HVC?".

We are taking a leap of faith by assuming that the only thing that
will UNDEF at EL2 while the stubs are installed is HVC. If anything
else occurs, I have no idea what to do with it. I guess we could always
ignore it instead of treating it as a HVC (as it is done at the
moment).

Thanks,
