One problem is that ksoftirqd and the kprobes use are early_initcall(),
so we cannot count on ksoftirqd being spawned when kprobes first uses
synchronize_rcu_tasks().  Moving the selftest later won't fix this
problem, but rather just paper it over.

I was getting a splat, but I could easily believe that there are
configurations where the hang is totally silent.  In other words, I do
agree that this needs a proper fix.  All we need do is work out an
agreeable value of "proper".  ;-)

Moving kprobes initialization to early_initcall() [1] means that there
can be a call to synchronize_rcu_tasks() before the current spawning of
ksoftirqd.  Because synchronize_rcu_tasks() needs timers to work, it needs
softirq to work.  I know two straightforward ways to make that happen:

1.	Spawn ksoftirqd earlier.

2.	Suppress attempts to awaken ksoftirqd before it exists,
	forcing all ksoftirq execution on the back of interrupts.

Uladzislau and I each produced patches for #1, and I produced a patch
for #2.

The only other option I know of is to push the call to init_kprobes()
later in the boot sequence, perhaps to its original subsys_initcall(),
or maybe only as late as core_initcall().  I added Masami and Steve on
CC for their thoughts on this.

Is there some other proper fix that I am missing?

						Thanx, Paul
