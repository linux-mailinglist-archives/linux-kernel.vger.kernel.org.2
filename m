My Dear.I know that this letter may come to you as a big surprise.
Actually,Please do not feel disturbed for contacting you, My Names are
 Mrs. Elaina Vicente, 58 years old, I am  suffering from a long time
cancer and from all indication my condition is really  deteriorating
as my doctors have confirmed and courageously advised me that I may
not live beyond two months from now for the reason that my tumor has
reached a critical stage which has defiled all forms of medical
treatment. As a matter of fact,  I registered as a nurse by profession
while my husband was dealing on Gold Dust and Gold Dore Bars till his
sudden death the year 2017 then I took over his business till date. In
fact, at this moment I have a deposit sum of  [$8,500,000.00] with one
of the leading bank  but unfortunately I cannot visit the bank since I
m critically sick and powerless to do anything myself but my bank
account officer advised me to assign any of my trustworthy relative,
friends or partner with authorization letter to stand as the recipient
of my money but sorrowfully I don't have any reliable relative and no
child. Therefore, I want you to receive the money and take 30% to take
care of yourself and family while 70% should be used basically on
humanitarian purposes mostly to orphanages, Motherless babies home,
less privileged and disable citizens and widows around the world. and
as soon as I receive your response I shall send you my pictures,
banking records and with full contacts of my banking institution to If
you are interested in carrying out this task please contact me for
more details on this email.(mrseliana28@gmail.com)  okay, I wait your
response soon, Yours Mrs Eliana.
