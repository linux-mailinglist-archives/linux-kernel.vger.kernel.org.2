It may also depend on the limit set by user space.

Not really.

In that case setting policy->max to 1/2 of cpuinfo.max_freq would
cause schedutil to choose 1/4 of cpuinfo.max_freq for 50% utilization
which would be rather unexpected.

policy->max is a cap, not the current maximum capacity.

Which is not how it is expected (and defined) to work, though.

If you really want to play with the current maximum capacity, you need
to change it whenever boost is disabled or enabled - and there is a
mechanism for updating cpufinfo.max_freq in such cases.
