Good point - I'll add that.

Indeed - I'll add the clarification.

Yes either KVM_ARM_TAGS_TO_GUEST or KVM_ARM_TAGS_FROM_GUEST - again I'll 
clarify that.

Guest memory either exists (and has tags) or doesn't exist (assuming MTE 
is enabled for the guest). So the cases this can fail are:

  * The region isn't completely covered with memslots
  * The region isn't completely writable (and KVM_ARM_TAGS_TO_GUEST is 
specified).
  * User space doesn't have access to the memory (i.e. the memory would 
SIGSEGV or similar if the VMM accessed it).

Currently all the above produce the error -ENOENT, which now I come to 
enumerate the cases doesn't seem like a great error code (it's really 
only appropriate for the first)! Perhaps -EFAULT would be better.

Not sure how that got there - but will remove.
