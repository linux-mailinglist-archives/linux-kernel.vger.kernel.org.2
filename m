Subject: [PATCH v7 08/15] firmware: arm_scmi: Make SCMI transports configurable
Date:   Tue,  3 Aug 2021 14:10:17 +0100
Message-Id: <20210803131024.40280-9-cristian.marussi@arm.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.17.1
In-Reply-To: <20210803131024.40280-1-cristian.marussi@arm.com>
References: <20210803131024.40280-1-cristian.marussi@arm.com>
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Add configuration options to be able to select which SCMI transports have
to be compiled into the SCMI stack.

Mailbox and SMC are by default enabled if their related dependencies are
satisfied.

While doing that move all SCMI related config options in their own
dedicated submenu.

Signed-off-by: Cristian Marussi <cristian.marussi@arm.com>
---
Used a BUILD_BUG_ON() to avoid the scenario where SCMI is configured
without any transport. Coul dnot do in any other way in Kconfig due to
circular dependencies.

This will be neeed later on to add new Virtio based transport and
optionally exclude other transports.

v6 --> v7
- using if ARM_SCMI_PROTOCOL to simplify depends
