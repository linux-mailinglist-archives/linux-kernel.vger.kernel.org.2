Being able to express a "panel selector" like this would certainly be
helpful in a number of phones, where a set of gpios or adc values are
read to determine which panel is actually mounted.

This is easier to do in the bootloader than your case, but the
bootloaders I've seen doing this have a tendency to come with a
dependency on the DT structure - which wouldn't match the upstream
approved DT bindings...
