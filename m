Um, no, they're getting renamed providers with some annoying API
changes that require a bit of a rewrite but the concept of a crypto
"engine" plug in to the code base isn't going away.

We already do ... grep ENGINE in scripts/sign-file.c

Just by the way in case anyone is interested in history:

PKCS11 can't cover everyting engines can.  Engines are mostly used for
accelerators, which are not in the PKCS11 API and even for external
keys, PKCS11 can't cope if the key isn't inside what PKCS11 thinks of
as a token.
