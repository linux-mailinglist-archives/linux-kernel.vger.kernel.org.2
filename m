They are not in the "free_page_list" before sanitization process has put
them to there. So in that way the count is also better in sync with this
fix.

It was even before NUMA patches kind of out-of-sync, i.e. free pages count
was incremented before putting them to the free list, but it didn't matter
that much because sanitization is fairly fast and it only prevented ksgxd
to trigger small time after the booth.

I think I'll send the fix for this now as a separate patch with a better
descriptino so that I can use more time to the attributes and implement
that properly at once.
