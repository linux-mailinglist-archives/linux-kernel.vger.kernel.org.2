Hmm, I thought "opp-level = RPMH_REGULATOR_LEVEL_*" did *something*,
but tbh I'm not sure exactly what..

I suppose "NAP" is a reasonable name.

But I think that reverting to previous behavior would not be enough,
there is nothing stopping devfreq from jumping from min to max freq,
which AFAIU should be enough to trigger this.  I guess that there just
hasn't been enough testing with different game workloads on those
phones to trigger this.

That said, I haven't seen similar issues on my sdm850 laptop, where I
defn have triggered mix->max freq transitions.. I guess it would be
interesting to know if this issue could be reproduced on db845c, or if
it really is board specific?

To workaround, I think we'd need to implement some way to limit that
maximum frequency jump (and then use delayed work to continue ramping
up the freq over time until we hit the target).. which seems like a
lot of work if this is just a board(s) specific workaround and isn't
needed once CPR is supported
