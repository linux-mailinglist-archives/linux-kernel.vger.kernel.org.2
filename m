I briefly checked this patch together with 
 v3 memcg: prohibit unconditional exceeding the limit of dying tasks
 over v5.15-rc4.
I executed LTP on host, all oom, cgroup and memcg tests was successfully finished.
and then experimented with memcg limited LXC containers.
I did not noticed any troubles on my test node.
Thank you,
