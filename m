Yeah, but we can forcefully break this whenever we feel like by revoking
the page, moving it, and then reinstating the gpu pte again and let it
continue.

If that's no possible then what we need here instead is an mlock() type of
thing I think.

Nice, thanks for the pointer.

Well I don't have ideas for the details tbh, just from the little I
learned about how this all fits together pretending to be a pin while
pretending to not be a pin just gets us back to the mess we're trying to
solve with gup vs pup cleanup. And given that the pin_user_pages rollout
hasn't even completed yet it's maybe way to early to already toss it out
again.

I think overall we should try really hard to not mix up things between
memory that's pinned and memory that can be moved. Because retroactively
trying to fix things up just because it was easier to get a feature going
that way is very, very hard. And I think we've demonstrated countless
times that "ah we just fix this with pinning, it doesn't happen often, no
one will notice" always comes back to bite us later on :-)

Like just looking ahead, 1GB pages are a thing, we will have to support
that, migrate_page is the only way to get there, and statistically just a
1/256th chance of encountering a pinned page guarantees we'll never
assemble a giant page.

Cheers, Daniel
