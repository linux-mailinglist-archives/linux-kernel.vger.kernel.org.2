I meant, the IOASID allocated via /dev/ioasid is in a clean state (just a
number). It's initial state is not bound to an mm. Unlike, sva_bind_device()
where the IOASID is allocated during bind time.

The use case is to support guest SVA bind, where allocation and bind are in
two separate steps.

True for PASID used in native SVA bind. But for binding with a guest mm,
PASID is allocated first (VT-d virtual cmd interface Spec 10.4.44), the
bind with the host IOMMU when vIOMMU PASID cache is invalidated.

Our intention is to have two separate interfaces:
1. /dev/ioasid (allocation/free only)
2. /dev/sva (handles all SVA related activities including page tables)

yes, but only for the use cases that need to expose PASID to the userspace.
AFAICT, the cases are:
1. guest SVA (bind guest mm)
2. full PF/VF assignment(not mediated) where guest driver want to program
the actual PASID onto the device.

I agree, this is the case PASID is hidden from the userspace, right? e.g.
uacce.

Would the above two use cases constitute the "complicated" criteria? Or we
should say anything that need the explicit PASID value has to through
/dev/ioasid?

Could you give some highlevel hint on the APIs that hook up IOASID
allocated from /dev/ioasid and use cases that combine device and domain
information? Yi is working on /dev/sva RFC, it would be good to have a
direction check.

We were thinking the allocation IOCTL is on a per set basis, then we know
the ownership of between PASIDs and its set. If per PASID FD is needed, we
can extend.

I tried to document the concept in
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1614463286-97618-2-git-send-email-jacob.jun.pan@linux.intel.com/

In terms of usage for guest SVA, an ioasid_set is mostly tied to a host mm,
the use case is as the following:
1. Identify a pool of PASIDs for permission checking (below to the same VM),
e.g. only allow SVA binding for PASIDs allocated from the same set.

2. Allow different PASID-aware kernel subsystems to associate, e.g. KVM,
device drivers, and IOMMU driver. i.e. each KVM instance only cares about
the ioasid_set associated with the VM. Events notifications are also within
the ioasid_set to synchronize PASID states.

3. Guest-Host PASID look up (each set has its own XArray to store the
mapping)

4. Quota control (going away once we have cgroup)

We don't see a use case for passing ioasid_set to another process. All the
four use cases above are for the current process.
