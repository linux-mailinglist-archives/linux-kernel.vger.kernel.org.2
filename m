I didn't look closely to the history but it is possible that during the
ECC engine framework introduction and the split of the on-die ECC code
the behavior changed (which, in this case, is a regression).

Yes I remember now!

I think the reason is that most ECC codes do not cover the OOB part,
hence writing garbage there is not an issue (while with your part, the
OOB area was actually fully protected). But it is certainly best to keep
this area tidy anyway.

I think this patch is legit, I will keep it.
