May the Lord Almighty be with you....
I AM A WIDOW OF THE LATE Mr. David Lunner, I AM 59 YEARS OLD. My name is
Josephine HOLLAND. I am married to the late Mr David HOLLAND, who worked
at the French Embassy here in Lom=C3=A9 -Togo in West Africa for nine years
before dying in
year 2019.

You have been chosen to receive a cash donation from my late husband
which finances $5.7,000,000.00 (five million, seven hundred thousand
US Dollars) to help the poor and orphanages through their
sincere help before my death. I am suffering from cancer for a long time
the breast, it seems my condition is really deteriorating.
and it's pretty obvious that I wouldn't live up to it anymore
to my doctor because the cancer has reached a very bad stage that
Hope I'm a living person again, All I need from you is yours
sincerity in using these funds to make this project as I wanted and needed
your information about where My Bank will send the funds,

such as:
Recipient's Name: _ Address: _ Telephone
number: _ Country: _

Please don't be offended by the way or the way I came to you as a
weird to do that, it's the only way i could get to you later
passing through your contacts ID. I will give you the contacts of the
Bank. For legitimacy with a letter of authority that will establish
you as my designated beneficiary of this money.

I am waiting for your reply.
From Sister Josephine HOLLAND.

You must contact me through my private email address:
