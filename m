No, its not seen in the real world. It was theoretical, and noted as
possible by Minchan Kim. I reviewed it, and I agree the race is
possible.

I am not saying they are.

The reason dev_type_get() was implemented was precisely to allow for
this to be expanded with the other types as they the *get* is specific to
the type.

Yes true. I think the better way to resolve that is to introduce and use
*try* methods, and so rmmod always trumps a new *get* for these
operations.

That would sole the possible "DOS" issue, precisely how I resolved this
same concern for resolving the deadlock with try_module_get().

Sorry, did you mean you thought about this, or you meant sleep as in
the sleep context?

The still presents the DOS issue, which I actually did want to avoid.
I avoided it on the other deadlock issue, and so ideally I'd also
want to avoid it here. But indeed, the bus route is simple and clean.
And an alternative to the DOS issue is we just use capability checks,
if we don't do that already.

Yup...

OK.

Yup. The above was a proof of concept solution using type, but indeed,
the downside is we'd have to implement try methods when not found, and
likely the list of types is endless.

Are there places where we cannot use the bus?

Live patching needs to lock code ;) and hey it works ;)

Addressing the kobject refecount here should in theory address most
deadlocks (what my third patch addresses) as well becuase, as you imply,
our protection of the kobject should prevent removal, but that's not
always the case. I think you're failing to consider a shared global
driver lock, which can be used on sysfs files, which in turn have
*nothing* kref'd. And so the module removal can still try to nuke sysfs
files, if those sysfs files like to mess with the shared global driver
lock.
