Not simple to answer... As discussed a mechanism is requested by some developer
to be able on a ns announcement to inform the remote side that the user
application or the client driver is ready to communicate, the endpoint creation
could be the trigger.

That said, let's go by steps. For this patchset I will try to come back to my
first implementation where i created the endpoint on probe.

"fixed_ept" could be miss-understood . It can be interpreted as an endpoint with
a fixed address (not set to RPMSG_ADDR_ANY).
What about "default_ept" or "static_ept"?
