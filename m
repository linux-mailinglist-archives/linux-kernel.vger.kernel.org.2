The problem with this is that it will require quite some work on the
MDS-side because, AFAIU, the MDS will need to handle different versions of
the CEPH_MSG_CLIENT_METRICS message (with and without the new copy-from
metrics).

Will this extra metric ever be useful on the MDS side?  From what I
understood Patrick's initial request was to have a way to find out, on the
client, if remote copies are really happening.  (*sigh* for not having
tracepoints.)

Anyway, I can look into adding this to the metrics infrastructure, but
it'll likely take me some more time to get to it and to figure out (once
again) how the messages versioning work.

Cheers,
