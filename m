I assume you still had aquarium running, to keep the gpu awake while
you ran that loop?

Fwiw, I modified this slightly to match sc7180's min/max gpu freq and
could not trigger any issue.. interestingly sc7180 has a lower min
freq (180) and higher max freq (800) so it was toggling over a wider
freq range.  I also tried on a device that  had the higher 825MHz opp
(since I noticed that was the only opp that used
RPMH_REGULATOR_LEVEL_TURBO_L1 and wanted to rule that out), but could
not reproduce.

I guess a630 (sdm845) should have higher power draw (it is 2x # of
shader cores and 2x GMEM size, but lower max freq).. the question is,
is this the reason we see this on sdm845 and not sc7180?  Or is there
some other difference.  On the gpu side of this, they are both closely
related (ie. the same "sub-generation" of a6xx, same gmu fw, etc)..
I'm less sure about the other parts (icc, rpmh, etc)
