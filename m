Worry about future issues then, in the future :)

But again, this is now hard to understand and if you run across a '0' in
the call, you have to go and look it up, breaking your reading flow.

Please just create a new function for this new option, and then have
both of them call the common function with a boolean for this "allocate
or not" type of thing.  We do this all the time in the kernel to make it
easier to read and understand over time.
