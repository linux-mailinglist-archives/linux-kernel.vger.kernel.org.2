+Userspace driver support for DFL devices
+========================================
+The purpose of an FPGA is to be reprogrammed with newly developed hardware
+components. New hardware can instantiate a new private feature in the DFL, and
+then present a DFL device in the system. In some cases users may need a
+userspace driver for the DFL device:
+
+* Users may need to run some diagnostic test for their hardware.
+* Users may prototype the kernel driver in user space.
+* Some hardware is designed for specific purposes and does not fit into one of
+  the standard kernel subsystems.
+
+This requires direct access to MMIO space and interrupt handling from
+userspace. The uio_dfl module exposes the UIO device interfaces for this
+purpose.
+
+Currently the uio_dfl driver only supports the Ether Group sub feature, which
+has no irq in hardware. So the interrupt handling is not added in this driver.
+
+UIO_DFL should be selected to enable the uio_dfl module driver. To support a
+new DFL feature via UIO direct access, its feature id should be added to the
+driver's id_table.
