I suspect the refcount of the of_node will be wrong here and upon
removing the aux device things will be off...

Instead, I think you're looking for device_set_of_node_from_dev(), which
also sets of_node_reused, which in turn causes pinctrl_bind_pins() to be
skipped - i.e. it seems to deal with the problem your comment describes.
