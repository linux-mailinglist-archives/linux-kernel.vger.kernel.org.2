A cover letter is useful when there are many patches, or when there is
some context that is important to remember.

But a changelog should always be added when you change something
between two versions. And the changelog can be located below the three
dashes ("---") without being part of the final commit message, it does
not need to be in a separate cover letter.

I see. Can you please try the following:

nandwrite -o /dev/mtdx /dev/zero
nanddump -ol1 /dev/mtdx

If the entire area is effectively free to be used, you should see 0's
everywhere. Otherwise you should have ff's somewhere.
