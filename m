It depends on the details of how the device works.  In most cases we do 
want to enable wakeup by default for host controller devices.  The 
reason is simple enough: If some USB device attached to the HC is 
enabled for wakeup and sends a wakeup request, we don't want the request 
to get lost because the HC isn't allowed to forward the request on to 
the CPU.

But we do not want to enable wakeup for root hubs.  In particular, we 
don't want to wake up a suspended system merely because a USB device has 
been plugged or unplugged.

Clearly this arrangement depends on the hardware making a distinction 
between wakeup requests originating from the root hub and those simply 
passing through the HC.
