I think a reasonable thing is to send SET_FEATURES before each
GET_CONFIG, to tell backend which format is expected.

The reason I like this one is that it also fixes MTU for virtio net,
and that one we can't really revert.

Sorry I was talking about the host not the guest.
when host sees revision > 0 it knows it's a modern guest
and so config should be LE.

you mean validate.
