yes, we really just hijacked drvdata as flags, it would be cleaner to use
flags explicitly.

You mean move #define SVM_FLAG_SUPERVISOR_MODE out of Intel code to be a
generic flag in iommu-sva-lib.h called IOMMU_SVA_BIND_SUPERVISOR?

I agree if that is the proposal.

True for native case but not limited to PASID#0 for guest case. E.g. for
mdev assignment with guest IOVA, the guest PASID would #0, but the host aux
domain default PASID can be non-zero. Here I meant to include both cases.

For the in-kernel private use, I don't think we should restrict based on
cgroup, since there is no affinity to user processes. I also think the
PASID allocation should just use kernel API instead of /dev/ioasid. Why
would user space need to know the actual PASID # for device private domains?
Maybe I missed your idea?
