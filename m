Isn't SMC64 going to be the overall majority going forward? Legacy
convention is for sure limited to CONFIG_ARM so I'll send another
follow-up patch to add a warning if we find legacy on CONFIG_ARM64.
SMC32 is hopefully no longer being produced given that it was introduced
at the time that the bootloader team wasn't supporting PSCI and didn't
want to support it. So we're making all new boards/SoCs/firmwares do
this calling convention probing to figure out something they already
know?

Maybe we should probe the calling convention on msm8994/msm8916 and
otherwise assume SMC64 on CONFIG_ARM64 kernels. I'd expect the exception
list to be smaller that way.

Sure but in theory the firmware would update the DT to indicate what
sort of firmware is there.

>=20

Heh, it tried to ensure we use the right calling convention but broke
things in the process, because the way of detecting the convention isn't
always there. I wouldn't be surprised if this comes up again for other
boards that use TF-A.
