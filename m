It would be enough to have even a short delay between write and read to
detect this case.  I _thought_ there should be a delay in this case,
but maybe it was removed after the patch was originally submitted?

Ted's understanding is correct - MMP is intended to be a backup mechanism
to prevent filesystem corruption in the case where external HA methods
do the wrong thing.  This has avoided problems countless times on systems
with multi-port access to the same storage, and can also be useful in the
case of shared VM images accessed over the network, and similar.

When MMP was implemented for ZFS, a slightly different mechanism was used.
Rather than having the delay to detect concurrent mounts, it instead writes
to multiple different blocks in a random order, and then reads them all.
If two nodes try to mount the filesystem concurrently, they would pick
different block orders, and the chance of them having the same order (and
one clobbering all of the blocks of the other) would be 1/2^num_blocks.
The drawback is that this would consume more space in the filesystem, but
it wouldn't be a huge deal these days.

One of the existing failure cases with HA that MMP detects is loss of
network connection, so I wouldn't want to depend on that.

Cheers, Andreas
