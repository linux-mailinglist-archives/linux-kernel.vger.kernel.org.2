FWIW, if you need to respin this for some reason, could you do me a
favour and add the following after the "Fixes" line please:

Link:
https://lore.kernel.org/r/4970a940-211b-25d6-edab-21a815313954@protonmail.com

That makes is easier to find related discussions and rationale behind a
certain change, as explained here:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/maintainer/configure-git.html

This line is not crucial, but it makes my life easier as well, as I
slowly start to track regressions again. And this time I'm doing it with
the help of a software I wrote just for this purpose. I used your report
as one of the first few to give this "regzbot" a test, hence the issue
can now be seen in the webinterface (which is still a bit ugly, but it
does the job):

https://linux-regtracking.leemhuis.info/regzbot/mainline.html

And the thing is: when regzbot sees a patch with above Link:-tag hit
mainline it will automatically mark the issue as resolved, saving me
some work.

Thx!

Ciao, Thorsten
