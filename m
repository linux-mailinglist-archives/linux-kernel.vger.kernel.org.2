Subject: [PATCH v2] tpm: tpm_tis_spi_cr50: Add default RNG quality
Date:   Fri, 29 Oct 2021 10:09:15 +0200

To allow this device to fill the kernel's entropy pool at boot,
setup a default quality for the hwrng found in Cr50.

After some testing with rngtest and dieharder it was, in short,
discovered that the RNG produces fair quality randomness, giving
around 99.93% successes in rngtest FIPS140-2.

Notably, though, when testing with dieharder it was noticed that
we get 3 WEAK results over 114, which isn't optimal, and also
the p-values distribution wasn't uniform in all the cases, so a
conservative quality value was chosen by applying an arbitrary
penalty to the calculated values.

For reference, this is how the values were calculated:

The dieharder results were averaged, then normalized (0-1000)
and re-averaged with the rngtest result (where the result was
given a score of 99.93% of 1000, so 999.3), then aggregated
together and averaged again.
An arbitrary penalty of -100 was applied due to the retrieved
value, which brings us finally to 700.
