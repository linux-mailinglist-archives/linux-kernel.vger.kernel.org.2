FYI: This is not strictly correct. In a coming product there is a
case where the data will be stored in RAM. Richard Gong was also
looking to use this driver to validate an image without programming
or storing it. The fpga-image-load driver has no expectation that
the data will be stored in nvmem, or even that it will be stored
at all.

These are all good points.
