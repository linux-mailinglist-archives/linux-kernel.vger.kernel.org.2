Dearest One,

I'm writing you this mail with the trust that only you can help me in
this situation for your trusted and God-fearing personality.

I'm sorry to intrude into your privacy. I saw your profile in the
webinternational domain database) when I was looking for a reliable
trustee to whom I should entrust my funds, I don't want to have my
offer declined because I have prayed over it and I'm convinced beyond
all doubts that you could be of help to me and carry out this offer
successfully, please kindly accept it with an open and positive mind.

I'm MRS  CORNELIA PASCAL 66 years, from (Lhasa) FRANCE  but based in
Republic of Burkina Faso. I have been here for over 14 years and have
been grappling with breast cancer disease. My doctor just confirmed to
me that I have just a few time to live. I'm a business woman dealing
on gold exportation before the sickness. I had an amount of fund that
I want you to help me get into your bank account to set up a project
to immortalize me if I eventually pass on.

Now that I'm ending this Earthly race in this sad manner without any
family members nor child, I deem it necessary to build an Orphanage
home. I had instructed the bank to transfer $2 million US dollar
personal fund in my account with the Africa Development Bank Burkina
Faso to St, Andrews Missionary Home Burkina Faso but my mind is still
not at rest. I'm writing you now through the help of a computer beside
my sick bed in the hospital.

My main reason of contacting you now is because of the sum of my $10.9
Million USD with the United Bank  of Africa here in Burkina Faso. I
had earlier instructed the bank to transfer the money to the bank
account of the first foreigner been male or female that will apply to
the claim of the Fund after my Death or Alive but you will assure me
with the name of God the most high that you will take only 40% for
yourself and use 60% to build an Orphanage Home with my name in your
country just to immortalize my time on Earth and my mind to be at
rest.

I shall give you the Email Address of the Bank and my data's once I
receive a positive response from you through this my private Email
Address:  mrscorneliap@gmail.com

Please, kindly Reply me with the details below for my confirmation so
that I can forward the Bank Email Address to you to contact them as
soon as possible.

2.Your Age:

if the money gets to your Bank Account/

Yours Sincerely.
Mrs Cornelia Pascal.
