 I sent this mail praying it will found you in a good condition of
health, since I myself are in a very critical health condition in
which I  sleep every night without knowing if I may be alive to see
the next day. I am Mrs.Carlsen Monika John  from Denmark wife of late
Mr Monika John , a widow suffering from long time illness. I have some
funds I inherited from my late husband, the sum of ($ 11.000.000
,elevenmilliondollars) my Doctor told me recently that I have serious
sickness which is cancer problem. What disturbs me most is my stroke
sickness.
Having known my condition, I decided to donate this fund to a good
person that will utilize it the way i am going to instruct herein. I
need a very honest and God fearing person who can claim this money and
use it for Charity works, for orphanages, widows and also  build
schools for less privileges that will be named after my late husband
if possible and to promote the word of God and the effort that the
house of God is maintained.

I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly
manner. That's why I'm taking this decision. I'm not afraid of death
so I know where I'm going. I accept this decision because I do not
have any child who will inherit this money after I die. Please I want
your sincerely and urgent answer to know if you will be able to
execute this project, and I will give you more information on how the
fund will be transferred to your bank account. I am waiting for your
reply.

May God bless you and your family.
Regards,
Mrs.Carlsen Monika John
written from Hospital.
