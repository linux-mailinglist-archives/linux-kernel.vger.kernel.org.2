In certain cases we need to write some values to a register to access
the rest of the values from some other registers. To handle such cases
DCC can also write to registers on system crash or software triggers if
necessary. The same is achieved through this sysfs interface in user 
space.

Ack. This attr is used to select the linked list to be used to configure 
the addresses.
The options given to the user is from 0-3.
