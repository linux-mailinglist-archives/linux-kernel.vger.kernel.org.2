Yes, and we had to bodge around this with function_nocfi() to get the
actual function address.

Really there should be a compiler intrinsic or attribute for this, given
the compiler has all the releveant information available. On arm64 we
had to us inine asm to generate the addres...

Taking a step back, it'd be nicer if we didn't have the jump-table shim
at all, and had some SW landing pad (e.g. a NOP with some magic bytes)
in the callees that the caller could check for. Then function pointers
would remain callable in call cases, and we could explcitly add landing
pads to asm to protect those. I *think* that's what the grsecurity folk
do, but I could be mistaken.

Ugh, yeah, we'll need to do the function_nocfi() dance somewhere...

Thanks,
Mark.
