Right, would something like this work ?

__split_huge_pmd_locked() calls __split_huge_zero_page_pmd() which will
replace a zero huge page with multiple (HPAGE_PMD_NR) zero small pages.
Why should MM_ANONPAGES stats change for the MM when the mapping is still
out there but in normal pages now.

Okay, sure.
