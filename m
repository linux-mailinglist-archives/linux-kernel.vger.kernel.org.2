Yes, this is exactly the issue.

Checking for NAND_ECC_ENGINE_TYPE_INVALID doesn't work, as the engine
type is already set to NAND_ECC_ENGINE_TYPE_ON_HOST by rawnand_dt_init.
The code there seems to expect that chip->ecc.engine_type contains the
default value, which is no longer the case after commit 525914b5bd8
("mtd: rawnand: xway: Move the ECC initialization to ->attach_chip()").

The following in attach_chip works:

if (chip->ecc.engine_type == NAND_ECC_ENGINE_TYPE_ON_HOST)
	chip->ecc.engine_type = NAND_ECC_ENGINE_TYPE_SOFT;

However, this will also silently use the software ECC engine if anyone
actually configures the on-host hardware ECC engine in the device tree
(which is of course unsupported for xway).

Thanks,
Jan
