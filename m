Hi, I can sure I am not update the stress_madvise_dso.c.

My test environment is vm (qemu-system-aarch64, 32 cores). And I can 
think of the following possibilities:

(1) in thread_read()

printf("read %s\n", dso_path);
d = open(dso_path, O_RDONLY);
/* The start addr must be alignment with 2M */
void *p = mmap((void *)0x40000dc00000UL, 0x800000, PROT_READ | 
PROT_EXEC,MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0);
if (p == MAP_FAILED) {
	perror("mmap");
	goto out;
}

0x40000dc00000 is random setting by myself. I am not sure this address 
is available in your vm.

(2) in thread_write()
int fd = open(dso_path, O_RDWR);
p = mmap(NULL, 0x800000, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);
if (p == MAP_FAILED) {
	perror("mmap");
         goto out; /* fail */
}

because of I am sure the DSO is bigger than 0x800000, so directly map 
the DSO using 0x800000. Maybe I had use '-z max-page-size=0x200000' to 
compile the DSO? likes:
$ gcc -z max-page-size=0x200000 -o libtest.so -shared libtest.o

If you don't mind, you can send the segment fault log to me. And I will
find x86 environment to test.

Thanks!
