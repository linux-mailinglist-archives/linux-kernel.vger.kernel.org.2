But it's still always a pointer.

And not only that, but two alternative fields in that union have *exactly* =
the
same type, so it's kind of artifically representing the problem more comple=
x
than it really is.

I'm not just getting, why all this complexity, and not a few casts instead?

I neither get the rename of "owner" to "private". It serves very little val=
ue.
I'm not saying that "owner" is best name ever but it's not *that* confusing
either. That I'm sure that it is definitely not very productive to rename i=
t.

Also there was still this "dirty". We could use ((void *)-1), which was als=
o
suggested for earlier revisions.
