Right, I would not suggest using pr_err everywhere.

So I am thinking that for running a test, -v means different levels logs 
for test code and for core (non-test code). For example, -v prints 
pr_warn() and higher for test logs, but nothing for core logs. And then 
-vv for running a test gives pr_debug and above for test logs, and 
pr_warn and above for core logs. Or something like that.

Maybe that is not a good idea. But I'm just saying that it's hard to 
debug currently at -v for tests.

Thanks,
John
