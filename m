Well, it depends. The HW is preventing proper full-blown swap + migration
support for PMD, similar to what we have for PTE, because we simply don't
have enough OS-defined bits in the PMD. A 5-bit swap type for example,
similar to a PTE, plus the PFN would not be possible.

The HW would not prevent a similar mechanism in principle, i.e. we could
mark it as invalid to trigger a fault, and have some magic bits that tell
the fault handler or migration code what it is about.

For handling migration aspects only, w/o any swap device or other support, a
single type bit could already be enough, to indicate read/write migration,
plus a "present" bit similar to PTE. But even those 2 bits would be hard to
find, though I would not entirely rule that out. That would be the tricky
part.

Then of course, common code would need some changes, to reflect the
different swap/migration (type) capabilities of PTE and PMD entries.
Not sure if such an approach would be acceptable for common code.

But this is just some very abstract and optimistic view, I have not
really properly looked into the details. So it might be even more
tricky, or not possible at all.

OK, as long as we don't get any broken PMD migration entries established
for s390, some extra THP splitting would be acceptable I guess.
