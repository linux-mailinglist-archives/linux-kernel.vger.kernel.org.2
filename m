This was meant for 5.12 but the timing was *way* too early. I'll take this
one back. Just to unambiguity reasons I'll use tpmdd-next-v5.12-rc1-v2 tag
for my final v5.12 PR, once I send it.

I considered a bit, and I really think that it would make a lot of sense
to do a late 5.11 just containing the two commits from James, namely:

1. tpm_tis: Fix check_locality for correct locality acquisition
2. tpm_tis: Clean up locality release 

James: Does this make sense to you?
