Sorry, I missed that in your original email.

So it is difficult to be 100% sure without knowing which particular access
caused the KCSAN warning but I'm quite confident it was caused by one of
unlocked accesses to jh->b_transaction in jbd2_journal_dirty_metadata().
And as the comments explain, these are only assertions which we redo under
proper lock if they look like they would fail. So the code is in fact
correct.
