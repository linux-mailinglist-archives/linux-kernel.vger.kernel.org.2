Subject: [PATCH v4 0/3] Add Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. PM8008 MFD driver

Changes from v3:
  - Addressed Lee's comments. 
  - This patchset is still based on regmap.git's for-next branch as my
    regmap-irq changes have not yet landed in mfd.git for-mfd-next or
    for-mfd-next-next (please advise which branch to use in this regard).

Changes from v2:
  - Collected Rob Herring's Acked-by for the IRQ listing patch
  - Addressed Rob's comments for the dt-bindings patch

Changes from v1:
  - Removed errant Change-Id from dt-bindings IRQ patch and gathered Bjorn's
    Reviewed-by
  - Fixed up YAML errors using make dt_binding_check

This driver is dependent on changes that have been made to the regmap-irq
framework that have currently been accepted [1][2] in regmap.git upstream by
Mark Brown but haven't made it to Linus' tree yet. For this reason, this driver
has been based on the tip of regmap.git and not mfd.git.

Those changes, and this driver, are the result of a rewrite effort that was
promised a long ago [3]. The framework changes and this driver have been tested
and verified end-to-end on an internal platform.
