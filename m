Hi Doug,

Thanks for posting this, and sorry for the delay in getting to it.

Watch out, your days are numbered! See [1].

I can see that you've put a lot of effort into this, but I'm not thrilled
with the prospect of maintaining these heuristics in the kernel. The
callchain behaviour is directly visible to userspace, and all we'll be able
to do is throw more heuristics at it if faced with any regression reports.
Every assumption made about userspace behaviour results in diminishing
returns where some set of programs no longer fall into the "supported"
bucket and, on balance, I don't think the trade-off is worth it.

If we were to do this in the kernel, then I'd like to see a spec for how
frame-pointer based unwinding should work for Thumb and have it agreed
upon and implemented by both GCC and LLVM. That way, we can implement
the unwinder according to that spec and file bug reports against the
compiler if it goes wrong.

In lieu of that, I think we must defer to userspace to unwind using DWARF.
Perf supports this via PERF_SAMPLE_STACK_USER and PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_USER,
which allows libunwind to be used to create the callchain. You haven't
mentioned that here, so I'd be interested to know why not.

Finally, you've probably noticed that our unwinding code for compat tasks
is basically identical to the code in arch/arm/. If the functionality is
going to be extended, it should be done there first and then we will follow
to be compatible.

Cheers,

Will
