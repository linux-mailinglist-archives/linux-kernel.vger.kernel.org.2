Add a man page for tracefs_sql(). Included in that man page is a full
working sql parser example program that can allow you to create synthetic
events from writing SQL on the command line.

+NAME

+tracefs_sql - Create a synthetitc event via an SQL statement
+
+SYNOPSIS
+--------
+[verse]
+--
+*#include <tracefs.h>*
+
+struct tracefs_synth *tracefs_sql(struct tep_handle pass:[*]tep, const char pass:[*]name,
+				  const char pass:[*]sql_buffer, char pass:[**]err);
+--
+
+DESCRIPTION
+-----------
+Synthetic events are dynamically created events that attach two existing events
+together via one or more matching fields between the two events. It can be used
+to find the latency between the events, or to simply pass fields of the first event
+on to the second event to display as one event.
+
+The Linux kernel interface to create synthetic events is complex, and there needs
+to be a better way to create synthetic events that is easy and can be understood
+via existing technology.
+
+If you think of each event as a table, where the fields are the column of the table
+and each instance of the event as a row, you can understand how SQL can be used
+to attach two events together and for another event (table). Utilizing the
+SQL *SELECT* *FROM* *JOIN* *ON* [ *WHERE* ] syntax, a synthetic event can easily
+be created from two different events.
+
+
+*tracefs_sql*() takes in a *tep* handler (See _tep_local_events_(3)) that is used to
+verify the events within the _sql_buffer_ expression. The _name_ is the name of the
+synthetic event to create. If _err_ points to an address of a string, it will be filled
+with a detailed message on any type of parsing error, including fields that do not belong
+to an event, or if the events or fields are not properly compared.
+
+The example program below is a fully functional parser where it will create a synthetic
+event from a SQL syntax passed in via the command line or a file. 
+
+The SQL format is as follows:
+
+*SELECT* <fields> FROM <start-event> JOIN <end-event> ON <matching-fields> WHERE <filter>
+
+Note, although the examples show the SQL commands in uppercase, they are not required to
+be so. That is, you can use "SELECT" or "select" or "sElEct".
+
+For example:
+[source,c]
+--
+SELECT syscalls.sys_enter_read.fd, syscalls.sys_exit_read.ret FROM syscalls.sys_enter_read
+   JOIN syscalls.sys_exit_read
+   ON syscalls.sys_enter_read.common_pid = syscalls.sys_exit_write.common_pid
+--
+
+Will create a synthetic event that with the fields:
+
+  u64 fd; s64 ret;
+
+Because the function takes a _tep_ handle, and usually all event names are unique, you can
+leave off the system (group) name of the event, and *tracefs_sql*() will discover the
+system for you.
+
+That is, the above statement would work with:
+
+[source,c]
+--
+SELECT sys_enter_read.fd, sys_exit_read.ret FROM sys_enter_read JOIN sys_exit_read
+   ON sys_enter_read.common_pid = sys_exit_write.common_pid
+--
+
+The *AS* keyword can be used to name the fields as well as to give an alias to the
+events, such that the above can be simplified even more as:
+
+[source,c]
+--
+SELECT start.fd, end.ret FROM sys_enter_read AS start JOIN sys_exit_read AS end ON start.common_pid = end.common_pid
+--
+
+The above aliases _sys_enter_read_ as *start* and _sys_exit_read_ as *end* and uses
+those aliases to reference the event throughout the statement.
+
+Using the *AS* keyword in the selection portion of the SQL statement will define what
+those fields will be called in the synthetic event.
+
+[source,c]
+--
+SELECT start.fd AS filed, end.ret AS return FROM sys_enter_read AS start JOIN sys_exit_read AS end
+   ON start.common_pid = end.common_pid
+--
+
+The above labels the _fd_ of _start_ as *filed* and the _ret_ of _end_ as *return* where
+the synthetic event that is created will now have the fields:
+
+  u64 filed; s64 return;
+
+The fields can also be calculated with results passed to the synthetic event:
+
+[source,c]
+--
+select start.truesize, end.len, (start.truesize - end.len) as diff from napi_gro_receive_entry as start
+   JOIN netif_receive_skb as end ON start.skbaddr = end.skbaddr
+--
+
+Which would show the *truesize" of the _napi_gro_receive_entry_ event, the actual
+_len_ of the content, shown by the _netif_receive_skb_, and alse the delta between
+the two and expressed by the field *diff*.
+
+The code also supports recording the timestamps at either event, and performing calculations
+on them. For wakeup latency, you have:
+
+[source,c]
+--
+select start.pid, (end.TIMESTAMP_USECS - start.TIMESTAMP_USECS) as lat from sched_waking as start
+   JOIN sched_switch as end ON start.pid = end.next_pid
+--
+
+The above will create a synthetic event that records the _pid_ of the task being woken up,
+and the time difference between the _sched_waking_ event and the _sched_switch_ event.
+The *TIMESTAMP_USECS* will truncate the time down to microseconds as the timestamp usually
+recorded in the tracing buffer has nanosecond resolution. If you do not want that
+truncation, use *TIMESTAMP* instead of *TIMESTAMP_USECS*.
+
+Finally, the *WHERE* clause can be added, that will let you add filters on either or both events.
+
+[source,c]
+--
+select start.pid, (end.TIMESTAMP_USECS - start.TIMESTAMP_USECS) as lat from sched_waking as start
+   JOIN sched_switch as end ON start.pid = end.next_pid
+   WHERE start.prio < 100 && (!(end.prev_pid < 1 || end.prev_prio > 100) || end.prev_pid == 0)
+--
+
+*NOTE*
+
+Although both events can be used together in the *WHERE* clause, they must not be mixed outside
+the top most "&&" statements. You can not OR (||) the events together, where a filter of one
+event is OR'd to a filter of the other event. This does not make sense, as the synthetic event
+requires both events to take place to be recorded. If one is filtered out, then the synthetic
+event does not execute.
+
+[source,c]
+--
+select start.pid, (end.TIMESTAMP_USECS - start.TIMESTAMP_USECS) as lat from sched_waking as start
+   JOIN sched_switch as end ON start.pid = end.next_pid
+   WHERE start.prio < 100 && end.prev_prio < 100
+--
+
+The above is valid.
+
+Where as the below is not.
+
+[source,c]
+--
+select start.pid, (end.TIMESTAMP_USECS - start.TIMESTAMP_USECS) as lat from sched_waking as start
+   JOIN sched_switch as end ON start.pid = end.next_pid
+   WHERE start.prio < 100 || end.prev_prio < 100
+--
+
+
+RETURN VALUE
+------------
+Returns 0 on success and -1 on failure. On failure, if _err_ is defined, it will be
+allocated to hold a detailed description of what went wrong if it the error was caused
+by a parsing error, or that an event, field does not exist or is not compatible with
+what it was combined with.
