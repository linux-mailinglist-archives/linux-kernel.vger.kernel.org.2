Hello Dear,

Please bear with me, I am writing this mail to you with tears and
sorrow from my heart. I am Miss Aisha =C2=A0Ibrahim =C2=A0Coulibaly, I am 2=
4
years old female =C2=A0and also a medical student from the Republic of
Ivory Coast, West Africa, I =C2=A0am the Daughter of Late Chief Sgt.Warlor
Ibrahim Coulibaly (a.k.a General =C2=A0IB). My late beloved father was a
well known Ivory Coast militia leader. He =C2=A0died on Thursday 28 April
2011 following a fight with the Republican Forces of Ivory Coast

(FRCI).https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibrahim_Coulibaly

I am constrained to contact you because of the maltreatment which I am
receiving from my step mother. After several years of the death of my
beloved father passed, One faithful morning I was cleaning my father=E2=80=
=99s
bed =C2=A0room when I discovered a brief case containing some valuable
documents that =C2=A0states that I am the next of kin to an account deposit
in the neighboring =C2=A0country Burkina Faso with the total sum of
US$5.8Million. Ignorantly out of excitement, I rushed and inform my
step mother and that was when my problem started. =C2=A0She conspired with
my uncles to kill me by all means but failed, mine wicked step mother
tried to poison me twice but I survived it all.

After which I escaped to Burkina Faso by road because she seized all
my traveling documents.

Now I am passing through very difficult situation in the refugee camp
here =C2=A0in Burkina Faso where I am hiding with total fear and agony
because my =C2=A0wicked step mother can go to any length to achieve her
motives. I have =C2=A0contacted the Bank to clear the deposit but the
Branch Director told me =C2=A0that being a refugee in the country, my
status according to the local law =C2=A0does not authorize me to carry out
the operation, and insist that I will =C2=A0have to appoint or present
someone to stand for me for the claim. However I =C2=A0am seeking for a
long term relationship and investment assistance from you =C2=A0to stand as
my trustee and partner so that the bank can transfer the fund =C2=A0to your
account in your country,=C2=A0And for you to also help me to come over =C2=
=A0to
your country for investment and to start a new life again as well as
complete my studies in the school of medicine which have been the wish
of =C2=A0my beloved late father. As soon as I receive a positive respond
from you, I =C2=A0will not hesitate to send across to you all the
information concerning the =C2=A0deposit. And I promise to give you 30% of
the total sum for your help and assistant.

Please note that if you must get in touch with me then you must reply
me back through my private box (aishibrahim021@gmail.com) and please
if you are not interested do not waste your time to reply kindly
delete my message from your box ok.

Waiting to hear from you =C2=A0soonest.

Miss Aisha Ibrahim
