I am sure there are, but I don't know any pointers. Either case, commenting
out include files until it fails to compile is not a good idea.
The driver then may compile with one architecture but fail with another.

Please drop them. They can be added back as needed.

Sorry, you lost me there. Those functions use shift operations to move
the sign bit where it belongs, and the shift back retains the sign bit.
What is wrong with that ?

Also:

int main()
{
         unsigned int v1 = 247;
         int v2;
         int v3;

         v2 = (char)v1;
         v3 = (int)((char)v1);

         printf("%d %d %d\n", v1, v2, v3);

         return 0;
}

produces 247 -9 -9, so I don't fully follow what your (int)((char)tmp)
looks like. Besides, the outer typecast is not necessary.
In general,
	v2 = (char)v1;
is good enough since the char -> int conversion is automatic (and sign_extend32()
is indeed overkill for this situation).

Either case, please feel free to use 'char' if you like; I won't insist
on a change to int. However, please drop the "signed".

I don't know what exactly happens. Why don't you try by setting the
timeout to a really small value, one that _does_ result in this
situation ?

... but what I do know is that I don't understand why you insist having
the reinit_completion() _after_ the  wait call. The above doesn't explain
that. I see it as potentially racy, so if you want to keep the code as-is
I'll want to see a comment in the code explaining why it has to be done
this way, and how it is not racy.

Also: a return value of 0 from wait_for_completion_timeout()
already indicates a timeout. The subsequent regmap_read() to check
if the conversion is complete should not be necessary. If it does,
it really indicates a non-timeout problem. Are there situations
(other than the race condition I am concerned about) where
an interrupt can happen but DA9063_ADC_MAN is still set ?

If so, I think this needs a comment in the code, especially since there
is an extra i2c read which, after all, is costly. Also, this should
probably generate a different error code (-EIO, maybe), and
-ETIMEDOUT should be the result of wait_for_completion_timeout()
returning 0.

One would not report the raw value, but convert it to mÂ°C.

It can be exposed as read-only value if it is a read-only
register/value. Ultimately it is your call if it is indeed read-only.
It still provides some value in that case, but not much.
