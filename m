Ok, I just met with a bunch of folks that are actively working on
this.  Let me intro
Yonghyun Hwang <yonghyun@google.com>
Pete Swain <swine@google.com>
who will be the folks on point for this from Google.

My understanding after some clarifications today is that Google is
currently using a proprietary kernel patching mechanism that developed
around a decade ago, "pre-ksplice Oracle acquisition."  But we are
looking to transition to kpatch, and help towards supporting arm64.
Live patching is important for deploying kernel fixes faster than
predetermined scheduled draining of jobs in clusters.

The first steps for kpatch transition is supporting builds with Clang.
Yonghyun is working on that and my hope is he will have patches for
you for that soon.

Curiously, the proprietary mechanism doesn't rely on stack validation.
I think that such dependency was questioned on the cover letter
patch's thread as well.  Maybe there's "some traps to look out for"
you're referring to there?  I'm not privy to the details, though I
would guess it has to do with ensuring kernel threads aren't executing
(or planning to return through) code regions that are trying to be
patched/unpatched.  I am curious about frame pointers never being
omitted for arm64; is frame pointer chasing is unreliable in certain
contexts?

The internal functionality has been used heavily in production for
almost a decade, though without it being public or supporting arm64;
I'm not sure precisely how they solve such issues (or how others might
review such an approach).

Either way, the dependencies for live patching are less important, so
long as they are toolchain portable.  The ability to live patch kernel
images is ___important___ to Google.

Or will be. (Sorry, I didn't know we hadn't completed the transition
to kpatch yet.  It is "the opposite side of the house" from where I
work; I literally have 8 bosses, not kidding).

Though if kpatch moves to requiring GCC plugins for architectures we
use extensively or would like to use more of, that's probably going to
throw a wrench in multiple transition plans.  (The fleet's transition
to Clang is done, I'm not worried about that).

That's pretty cool!  Reuse outside the initial context is always a
good sign that something was designed right.

Heh.  I'm a big fan of game theory; carrot or stick, right?
