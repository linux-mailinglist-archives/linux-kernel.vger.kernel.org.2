And this is off topic to the discussion as well. We are not discussing
how to handle OOM situation best. Shakeel has brought up challenges that
some userspace based OOM killer implementations are facing. Like it or
not but different workloads have different requirements and what you are
using in Android might not be the best fit for everybody. I will not
comment on the android approach but it doesn't address any of the
concerns that have been brought up.
