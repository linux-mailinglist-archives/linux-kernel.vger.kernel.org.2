Sure will add this info as well in the next version.

Thanks for taking a look. Non-strict mode is only for leaf entries and
dma domains and this optimization is for non-leaf entries and is 
applicable
for both, see __arm_lpae_unmap(). In other words, if you have 
iommu.strict=0
(non-strict mode) and try unmapping a large sg buffer as the problem 
described
in the commit text, you would still go via this path in unmap and see 
the
delay without this patch. So what Robin suggested is that, let's do this
unconditionally for all users with non-strict mode as opposed to only
restricting it to implementation specific in case of strict mode.

Thanks,
Sai
