SUM OF THE MONEY. MEANWHILE, I DIDN'T FORGET YOU=E2=80=99RE PAST EFFORTS AN=
D
ATTEMPTS TO ASSIST ME IN TRANSFERRING THOSE FUNDS DESPITE THAT
EVERYTHING FAILED US SOMEHOW. NOW CONTACT MY SECRETARY IN BURKINA
FASO. MR. NELSON SALAH BY NAME: HIS E-MAIL nelson_salah@aol.com.

ASK HIM TO SEND YOU THE VISA CARD TOTAL SUM OF $2.500, 000.00.USD
