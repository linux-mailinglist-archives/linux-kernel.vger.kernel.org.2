That's a good question.

I guess various kernel continuous integration (CI) systems have panic_on_warn
enabled.

[Adding Dmitry Vyukov to this discussion]

If we look at the syzbot dashboard [1] with the results of Linux kernel fuzzing,
we see the issues that appear as various kernel crashes and warnings.
We don't see anything from pr_err(), pr_crit(), pr_alert(), pr_emerg(). Maybe
these situations are not considered as kernel bugs that require fixing.

Anyway, from a security point of view, a kernel warning output is interesting
for attackers as an infoleak. The messages printed by pr_err(), pr_crit(),
pr_alert(), pr_emerg() provide less information.

The do_group_exit() function calls do_exit() from kernel/exit.c, which is also
called during a kernel oops. This function cares about a lot of special cases
depending on the current task_struct. Is it fine?
