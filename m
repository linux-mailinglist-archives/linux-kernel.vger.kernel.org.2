That analogy would almost seem to suggest bad intent on my side.

To say that this workaround is no longer needed on !RT does not imply
that it is needed on RT. If anything it suggests I have considered RT,
I'd say.

Fair enough. I thought it was obvious from the commit message and the
commits referred to, and that RT wouldn't depend on patching random
mainline drivers like this without a clear marking such as using raw
spin locks.

Greg's already picked this one up and this is hopefully the last one
we'll see of these.
