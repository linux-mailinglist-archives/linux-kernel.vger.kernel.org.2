I was under the impression that we can have multiple pstore
implementations active, so we would have ramoops and dcc presented
side by side after such restart. Perhaps that's a misunderstanding on my
part?

My concern is that we come up with a custom chardev implementation for
something that already exists or should exist in a more generic form.


In the runtime sequence above, why don't you have trigger just generate
a devcoredump? But perhaps the answer is that we want a unified
interface between the restart and runtime use cases?


It would be nice to have some more details of how I can use this and how
to operate the sysfs interface to achieve that, would you be able to
elaborate on this?
