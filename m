Okay, thanks for the patches. I have applied them to both kernels, so the first
one and second one are the same and kexec tools have a patch provided in the
user space of the both kernels (only first one in use though).

Before applying your patch, I have reverted my hacks (as per this series).

Result is:

# uname -a
Linux buildroot 5.13.0-rc5+ #1 SMP Mon Jun 7 19:49:40 EEST 2021 i586 GNU/Linux
# dmidecode
# dmidecode 3.3
Scanning /dev/mem for entry point.
# No SMBIOS nor DMI entry point found, sorry.

I.o.w. it does NOT fix the issue. My patches do (with a hint from user space).
