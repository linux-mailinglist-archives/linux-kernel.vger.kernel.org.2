EXT4_FC_REPLAY is a mount state that is only set during jbd2 journal
recovery. The only way for jbd2 journal recovery to set EXT4_FC_REPLAY
option is if after a journal crash there are special fast_commit
blocks present in the journal. For these fast_commit blocks to be
present in the journal, the Ext4 file system prior to crash should
have had "fast_commit" feature enabled.

If we have a way to look at the Ext4 partition that syzbot used for
reporting this bug, it is very easy to see if this FC_REPLAY will ever
be set or not. Just running "debugfs <image>" and inside debugfs,
running logdump will show us if there are any fast commit blocks
present in the journal.

Having said that, I have following reason to believe that this option
wasn't set during the syzbot failure:

EXT4_FC_REPLAY will only be set during journal recovery and is cleared
immediately after. Which means EXT4_FC_REPLAY will only be set during
mount and as soon as mount returns the option will be cleared. Looking
at the stack trace, it shows no evidence that we are in the journal
recovery phase. It seems like most of the traces are resulting from
system calls made by the user. I checked if we are accidentally
setting this flag even after journal recovery, but that doesn't seem
to be the case. On a successfully mounted file system, we
unconditionally clear this flag.
