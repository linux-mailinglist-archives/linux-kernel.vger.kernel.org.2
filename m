Only that I wouldn't get too hung up on existing snapdragon ACPI
tables.. not sure if there is prior art as far as ACPI tables for this
on x86 systems, if so that *might* be a thing to consider, but
otherwise it does sound a bit like we want less qcom specific bindings
here.  But other than that I'll leave it to folks who spend more time
thinking about bindings.. left to my own devices I'd come up with a
point solution and go back to working on mesa, so that probably isn't
the opinion you want to follow ;-)
