Hmm, this looks weird. Why aren't we starting ksgxd only after
*everything* has initialized successfully? I.e., after both kvm and
native drivers' init functions have succeeded?

Then you won't have to do this kthread_should_stop() thing after the
fact.

Btw, you have the same thing in the while loop's termination condition
two lines down which, if I have to look at it later, would make me
scratch head as to what TH is going on here.

Thx.
