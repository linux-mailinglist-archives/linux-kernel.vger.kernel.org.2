I've lost track of the conversation here :/

When the GPU has a buffer mapped with IOMMU_LLC, is the buffer also mapped
into the CPU and with what attributes? Rob said "writecombine for
everything" -- does that mean ioremap_wc() / MEMREMAP_WC?

Finally, we need to be careful when we use the word "hint" as "allocation
hint" has a specific meaning in the architecture, and if we only mismatch on
those then we're actually ok. But I think IOMMU_LLC is more than just a
hint, since it actually drives eviction policy (i.e. it enables writeback).

Sorry for the pedantry, but I just want to make sure we're all talking
about the same things!

Cheers,

Will
