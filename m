I think it is useful info to report to the MDS, but it's not required to
send these to the MDS to solve the current problem. My suggestion would
be to add what's needed to track these stats in the kclient and report
them via debugfs, but don't send the info to the MDS just yet.

Later, we could extend the protocol with COPY stats, and add the
necessary infrastructure to the MDS to deal with it. Once that's in
place, we can then extend the kclient to start sending this info along
when it reports the stats.
