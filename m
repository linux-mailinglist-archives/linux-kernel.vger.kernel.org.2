I currently use virtme when I need to poke around in userspace, which
has been working well so far.

I suspect that your preinit could be used to make a boot-loader that
automatically knows the needed Linux-kernel filesystems, thus avoiding
the long series of bugs due to filesystem mismatches between the Linux
kernel and the boot loader.  In the old days, the larger size of the
Linux kernel would have been a problem, but given the size of firmware
these days, this should no longer be a problem.

But my guess is that this has already been tried.  Plus there would have
to be someone quite excited about doing a large body of boot-loader work.

Thoughts?

							Thanx, Paul
