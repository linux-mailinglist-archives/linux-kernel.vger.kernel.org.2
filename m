Hi Ulf,


Thanks for your explanation.

I think there may be some misunderstandings here.

Our purpose is to avoid our GL9763e from entering ASPM L1 state during
a sequence of 4K read requests. So we don't have to consider about the
behavior/performance of the eMMC/SD card and what eMMC/SD card that is
being used. We just need to know what kind of requests we are
receiving now from the PCIe root port.

Besides, the APSM L1 is purely hardware behavior in GL9763e and has no
corresponding relationship with runtime PM. It's not activated by
driver and the behaviors are not handled by software. I think runtime
PM is used to handle the behaviors of D0/D3 of the device, but not the
link status of ASPM L0s, L1, etc.

I agree that the policy of balancing performance vs the energy cost is
a generic problem that all mmc drivers share. But our driver of
GL9763e is a host driver, the setting in this patch is also only for
GL9763e, could not be used by other devices. It depends on our
specific hardware design so that it is not a generic solution or
policy. So I think to implement such a patch in our specific GL9763e
driver to execute the specific actions just for our hardware design is
reasonable.

Thanks a lot.
