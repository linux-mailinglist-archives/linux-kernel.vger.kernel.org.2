I think latin alphabet cursive probably was based in Ra (upright more 
for Logo forms). And has moved to it. Also virtually I can use Norir as 
a virtual land, that also suits my work.

Ra Trance being a very correct identifier for the 9x style Trance music 
also, that is also mascot culture for what we can call Ra X. And I have 
much jokes on my channel from this.

Serenity,
