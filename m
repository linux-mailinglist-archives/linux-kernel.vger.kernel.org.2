Thanks.  I'd really appreciate it.

Completely understand.  Been there, got frustrated by that!

However, GKI is your friend here, since it operates an upstream-first
philosophy.  Samsung would not be able to utilise GKI if its platform
wasn't supported by upstream.  Regardless of who did the work, (not my
concern at this point) the platform is supported in Mainline.

Volunteers (including Linaro) do a bunch of upstreaming on behalf of
vendors, including some of the very largest/most successful.
Sometimes that just the way it goes - try not to take it too
personally.

Right.  And in the early stages, GKI is used for early (non-released)
H/W (this is also the part of the reason these differences can't be
upstreamed early/now/yet) and sometimes changes break things requiring
low-level debugging techniques to solve (inc. early console).

We don't know which drivers *need* to be built-in yet.

Clocks is probably not a good example even, since the power-on default
is most likely all-on, which is fine.  Pinctrl remains to be seen.

The is the part of the discussion that is the most contentious.

Ideally we wouldn't have to enable any ARCH_* explicitly.  Greg has
mentioned this publicly on a number of discussions.  However, removing
the dependencies (from Kconfig in this case) is in contention with
other user's use-cases.  No one wants to be asked seemingly irrelevant
configuration questions during the config stages of a kernel build.

So we are forced to enable ARCH_* to have our requirements built-in
(ARCH_EXYNOS for SAMSUNG_SERIAL [early console] in this case).
Unfortunately, this comes with additional cruft that we *might* not
want (resulting in bloat) or that we wish to overwrite with more
featureful driver modules.  We can't do that if these features are
built-in.

Please don't make this discussion about particular vendors.  Bringing
in emotional feelings pertaining to specific companies or individuals
does not make for a quality level-headed technical discussion.

The principles I'm discussing here are vendor agnostic.

I understand your frustration, but it's orthogonal to this discussion.
