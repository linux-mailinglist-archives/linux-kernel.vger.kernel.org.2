This describes *what* is done, but not *why*.  The why is that we want to ensure
that wrong keys get rejected early on, before the filesystem is mounted.

Also, what happens if we want to add support for a KDF other than HKDF-SHA512 in
the future?  With the existing fscrypt use of HKDF-SHA512, we can add support
for more KDFs by using one of the reserved fields in fscrypt_policy_v2 and
fscrypt_add_key_arg to indicate the KDF version.  But as proposed, metadata
encryption has no reserved fields in the filesystem superblock (that are
strictly validated).  It might be a good idea to add some reserved fields.

Filesystem metadata doesn't necessarily have an inode associated with it.  How
does that work?

We need to be very careful how we describe the metadata encryption feature
because it's not really self-explanatory; people are going to wonder:

- What is meant by "metadata"?
- How does it relate to dm-crypt, and why not just use dm-crypt?
- How does it interact with the existing filenames encryption?
- How does it interact with unencrypted files?

We need to explain it properly so that all these questions are answered.

I recommend adding metadata encryption as a top-level section in the
documentation file (not just in the Introduction and Implementation Details
sections as this patch currently proposes) and adding a proper explanation of it
from a user's perspective.  The Introduction should be kept brief.

Do we actually anticipate that filesystems might support metadata encryption but
not encrypt these types of metadata?  That would be weird, since the purpose of
metadata encryption is basically to ensure that everything gets encrypted.

This explains *what* is done, but not *why*.  The why is that we want to enforce
that the traditional fscrypt keys are at least as strong as the metadata
encryption key (if there is one).

This could use some explanation of *why* someone would want to enable this.

Also, "Enable metadata encryption" => "Enable support for metadata encryption".
Otherwise people could think that they are enabling encryption just by setting
this kernel config option.

Why is this passing 0 for first_fsblk instead of the filesystem block number?

This is going to be confused with fscrypt_metadata_crypt_bio().  Also, the fact
that this now does "metadata encryption" for file contents is confusing.  It
would be helpful to update the comments to make it very clear what is going on.

Also, does fscrypt_mergeable_bio() need to be updated too?

How about: "This makes @secret->raw at least as strong as the stronger of its
old value and the metadata_crypt_key."

This should be "Return: 0 on success and a negative value on error", otherwise
it isn't a valid kerneldoc comment.  You can run
'scripts/kernel-doc -v -none FILE' to check the validity of kerneldoc comments.

Adding a 1-2 sentence description above this function (not necessarily a full
kerneldoc comment) would be helpful to understand what is going on.

This is missing 'err = -ENOMEM' in the error path.

It might make more sense to log something like "Incorrect metadata encryption
key provided.".  The key identifiers being different is just how we determine
whether the keys are different; it's the latter that is actually important.

Adding 1-2 more sentences of explanation above would be helpful.

The calls to blk_crypto_start_using_key() also happen in
fscrypt_metadata_crypt_prepare_all_devices().  So why is this extra one needed?

prepare_all_devices => prepare_devices, to shorten this name a bit?

It would be good to use kfree_sensitive() here, in the case the implementation
of fscrypt_hkdf changes in the future (though it's not needed currently).

This is assuming that s_metadata_hkdf and s_metadata_key got allocated in a
particular order.  It would be better to just handle each field one at a time,
like:

void fscrypt_free_metadata_encryption(struct super_block *sb)
{
	int num_devices;
	int i;
	struct request_queue *q;

	if (sb->s_metadata_hkdf) {
		fscrypt_destroy_hkdf(sb->s_metadata_hkdf);
		kfree_sensitive(sb->s_metadata_hkdf);
		sb->s_metadata_hkdf = NULL;
	}

	if (sb->s_metadata_key) {
		num_devices = fscrypt_get_num_devices(sb);

		for (i = 0; i < num_devices; i++) {
			q = fscrypt_get_device(sb, i);
			if (WARN_ON(!q))
				continue;
			blk_crypto_evict_key(q, sb->s_metadata_key);
		}
		kfree_sensitive(sb->s_metadata_key);
		sb->s_metadata_key = NULL;
	}
}

It would be helpful to add an explanation of how this differs from
fscrypt_set_bio_crypt_ctx(), and how filesystems should decide which one to
call.  Also maybe one or both of them needs a better name?
