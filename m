to reach people randomly from different sources and modes so as to
touch lives from different angles, Hence you are getting a message
here.

You have been listed as one of the lucky recipients to receive $ 8.5

personal issues and mostly to generously help us extend hands of
giving to the less privileged, orphans and charity organizations
within your locality To verify
