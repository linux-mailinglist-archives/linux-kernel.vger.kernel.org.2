My comment was based on the DT binding requesting it also for PPI and
previous review requests for me to add it elsewhere, so it's quite
possible that your code analysis is correct.

FWIW also the cache nodes were not evaluated last time I checked,
although the specs do show those nodes and properties.

The /memory nodes are on the root node and thus only use #address-cells
and #size-cells from /, not from /soc here. Thus the only criterium is
whether something within /soc needs it.
PCI controllers may have 3 address cells, SPI/I2C controllers 1, so you
can have multiple sizes within one DT, you just need suitable ranges
wherever mappings to the parent address space are needed.
(I thought you had that distinction in an earlier draft I reviewed.)

Similarly, /reserved-memory would be outside the /soc node and use the
root node's #(address|size)-cells.

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/tree/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reserved-memory/reserved-memory.txt

Note: I'm assuming that if someone were to add a DT for the Cortex-M7s,
the address space mapping of any shared peripherals will likely differ,
as would the interrupts obviously, so I assume no direct .dtsi sharing
of /soc sub-nodes could sensibly be applied here.

@NXP: Please correct me if I'm wrong in either M7 not having access to
DDR RAM or large enough SRAM for Linux or another DT-consuming OS (and
this line of thinking not being applicable then) or you having use cases
to factor out some of the /soc sub-nodes for sharing between the two
(which would then give another reason for #address-/size-cells = <1> for
32-bit Cortex-M7).

Yes, as discussed in 7/8, you should be using here:

		ranges = <0x0 0 0x0 0x80000000>; /* excluding 4 GiB RAM */

You probably mean the GIC_CPU_MASK_SIMPLE()?

			interrupts = <GIC_PPI 9 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/tree/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/arm,gic-v3.yaml

The interrupts property will be used by KVM (or possibly Xen) for vGIC.
Please ensure that the Kconfig you use for testing has KVM enabled.
