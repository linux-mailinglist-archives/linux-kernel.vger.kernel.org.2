It is the same with virtio-ccw and virtio-pci. I see the same problem
with both on s390x. I didn't try with virtio-blk-pci-non-transitional
yet (have to figure out how to do that with libvirt) for pci I used
virtio-blk-pci.

You mean the device id? Yes that is bolted down in the spec, but
currently we don't exploit that information. Furthermore there
is a fat chance that with QEMU even the allegedly non-transitional
devices only present a little endian config space after VERSION_1
was negotiated. Namely get_config for virtio-blk is implemented in
virtio_blk_update_config() which does virtio_stl_p(vdev,
&blkcfg.blk_size, blk_size) and in there we don't care
about transitional or not:

static inline bool virtio_access_is_big_endian(VirtIODevice *vdev)
{
#if defined(LEGACY_VIRTIO_IS_BIENDIAN)
    return virtio_is_big_endian(vdev);
#elif defined(TARGET_WORDS_BIGENDIAN)
    if (virtio_vdev_has_feature(vdev, VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1)) {
        /* Devices conforming to VIRTIO 1.0 or later are always LE. */
        return false;
    }
    return true;
#else
    return false;
#endif
}

Don't think so. Both a transitional and a non-transitional device
would have to accept revisions higher than 0 if the driver tried to
negotiate those (and we do in our case).

We have a driver regression. Since the 82e89ea077b9 ("virtio-blk: Add
validation for block size in config space") virtio-blk is broken on
s390.

The deeper problem is in the spec. We stated that the driver may read
config space before the feature negotiation is finalized, but we didn't
think enough about what happens when native endiannes is not little
endian in the different cases.

I believe, for non-transitional devices we have a problem in the host as
well (i.e. in QEMU).

I tend to say we have a problem both in the host and in the guest. I'm
more concerned about the problem in the guest, because that is a really
nasty regression. For the host. I think for legacy we don't have a
problem, because both sides would operate on the assumption no
_F_VERSION_1, IMHO the implementation for the transitional devices is
correct. For non-transitional flavor, it depends on the device. For
example virtio-net and virtio-blk is broken, because we use primitives
like virtio_stl_p() and those don't do the right thing before feature
negotiation is completed. On the other hand virtio-crypto.c as a truly
non-transitional device uses stl_le_p() and IMHO does the right thing.

Thanks for your comments! I hope I managed to answer your questions. I
need some guidance on how do we want to move forward on this.

Halil
