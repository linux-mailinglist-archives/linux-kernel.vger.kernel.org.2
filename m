Great, please fix that up.

> Secondly, the problem this patch wants to solve isï¼š In this function, the parent variable is first called "kobject_get (kobj->parent) " assignment. When the parent is not null, the just obtained parent is assigned back to "kobj - > parent", which is meaningless. Actually, "kobj->kset->kobj" will be assigned to "kobj->parent" only when the parent is NULL. So this patch solves the problem of meaningless assignment.

Why is this a problem?  What bug is this solving?  Is the code somehow
now faster or smaller that can be measured?

I do not see a bug with this code, what is wrong with it?
