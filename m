The architecture documents have always called it interrupts.  The PEM
says it calls them exceptions instead, but they are called interrupts in
the architecture (and the PEM says that, too).

That document is 24 years old.  The architecture is still published,
new versions regularly.

They are defined in the architecture.

The simplest example is 700, program interrupt.  There are many causes
for it, including all the exceptions in FPSCR: VX, ZX, OX, UX, XX, and
VX is actually divided into nine separate cases itself.  There also are
the various causes of privileged instruction type program interrupts,
and  the trap type program interrupt, but the FEX ones are most obvious
here.
