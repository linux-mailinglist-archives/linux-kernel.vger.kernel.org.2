If you mean pstore backends(persistent ram and block device) as the
implementations, then yes they can separately coexist, but blk device
as the backend is not fully ready and ramoops only guarantees traces
if the DDR contents are retained i.e., on warm reboot.

In case of ramoops, we currently have console-ramoops, dmesg-ramoops,
ftrace-ramoops, pmsg-ramoops. We cannot add dcc-ramoops directly like
this as DCC is very platform specific(and QTI specific).

I wanted to add something like device-ramoops/misc-ramoops where the
device drivers could register with pstore and provide some useful debug
information but the size of ramoops reserved is usually very small and
is divided among all of these. So even if lets say we add DCC today and
later on multiple devices which are present in the same SoC, then the
reserved memory will not be enough and its not easy to properly divide
the memory regions to these devices within device-ramoops, there needs
to be some sort of dynamic reservation as the device probes, so its
currently on hold.

One other reason is the firmware being smart, such as depthcharge [1]
which deletes the ramoops DT node when it loads Kernel+DTB image and
adds its own ramoops node with the size it prefers(which is small) and
so we would need a firmware side change as well to accomodate dcc-ramoops.

Given so many dependencies for pstore ramoops, making it as a primary way
to get DCC trace logs doesn't seem right, we can add it as an addon feature.

Sorry if I misunderstood this comment, but DCC is part of QDSS(Qualcomm Debug
SubSystem) and is specific to QTI. We have Coresight TMC ETR/ETF exposing
similar dev interfaces which is somewhat similar to DCC in the sense that ETF
has its own internal RAM and DCC has the internal SRAM but they are 2 different
hardware IPs. Even in case of ETF, we can collect the live trace on the target
via dev interface and then decode it or collect ramdumps in case of fatal crashes
and then extract trace binary and decode it. So looks like such dev interface
already exists for other hardwares and works pretty well for the specific usecases.

Yes, in case of restart i.e., warm reboot since DCC SRAM contents are
retained, we can use the dev interface itself on the next reboot to
collect dcc logs if the memory is not zeroed out which I think current
driver code does which needs to be fixed.

Agreed, this needs more documentation. I will give one real world example on
SC7180 SoC based board where this could have been used, Souradeep can add more
and document it in cover letter for the next version of the patchset.

Example: (Addresses configured here are just examples and not related to actual
timestamp clks)

On SC7180, there was a coresight timestamp issue where it would occasionally
be all 0 instead of proper timestamp values.

Proper timestamp:
Idx:3373; ID:10; I_TIMESTAMP : Timestamp.; Updated val = 0x13004d8f5b7aa; CC=0x9e

Zero timestamp:
Idx:3387; ID:10; I_TIMESTAMP : Timestamp.; Updated val = 0x0; CC=0xa2

Now this is a non-fatal issue and doesn't need a system reset, but still needs
to be rootcaused and fixed for those who do care about coresight etm traces.
Since this is a timestamp issue, we would be looking for any timestamp related
clocks and such.

So we get all the clk register details from IP documentation and configure it
via DCC config syfs node. Before that we set the current linked list.

/* Set the current linked list */
echo 3 > /sys/bus/platform/devices/10a2000.dcc/curr_list

/* Program the linked list with the addresses */
echo 0x10c004 > /sys/bus/platform/devices/10a2000.dcc/config
echo 0x10c008 > /sys/bus/platform/devices/10a2000.dcc/config
echo 0x10c00c > /sys/bus/platform/devices/10a2000.dcc/config
echo 0x10c010 > /sys/bus/platform/devices/10a2000.dcc/config
..... and so on for other timestamp related clk registers

/* Other way of specifying is in "addr len" pair, in below case it
specifies to capture 4 words starting 0x10C004 */

echo 0x10C004 4 > /sys/bus/platform/devices/10a2000.dcc/config

/* Enable DCC */
echo 1 > /sys/bus/platform/devices/10a2000.dcc/enable

/* Run the timestamp test for working case */

/* Send SW trigger */
echo 1 > /sys/bus/platform/devices/10a2000.dcc/trigger

/* Read SRAM */
cat /dev/dcc_sram > dcc_sram1.bin

/* Run the timestamp test for non-working case */

/* Send SW trigger */
echo 1 > /sys/bus/platform/devices/10a2000.dcc/trigger

/* Read SRAM */
cat /dev/dcc_sram > dcc_sram2.bin

Get the parser from [1] and checkout the latest branch.

/* Parse the SRAM bin */
python dcc_parser.py -s dcc_sram1.bin --v2 -o output/
python dcc_parser.py -s dcc_sram2.bin --v2 -o output/

Sample parsed output of dcc_sram1.bin:

localhost ~ # cat dcc_captured_data.xml 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<hwioDump version="1">
        <timestamp>03/14/21</timestamp>
        <generator>Linux DCC Parser</generator>
        <chip name="None" version="None">
                <register address="0x0010c004" value="0x80000000" />
                <register address="0x0010c008" value="0x00000008" />
                <register address="0x0010c00c" value="0x80004220" />
                <register address="0x0010c010" value="0x80000000" />
        </chip>
        <next_ll_offset>next_ll_offset : 0x1c </next_ll_offset>
</hwioDump>

Now compare the parsed output for dcc_sram1.bin and dcc_sram2.bin, we will
find that one of these register values in working case and non-working case
is different which when cross checked with IP doc would give us the idea
of what is going wrong with the timestamp clks and would help to debug further.

PS: We didn't use DCC to debug this coresight timestamp issue but could have
used it and this example demonstrates the capability of DCC and I ran with
these above with actual timestamp clk registers and it works as demonstrated
here, so it's a working example.
