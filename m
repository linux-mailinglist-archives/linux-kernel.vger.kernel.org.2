I have in mind that to make RPMsg easy to use, we need a generic driver with a
basic user interface to send end receive data, that supports the NS announcement:
-  remote side could instantiate it.
-  an instantiation of the device by a Linux application generates a NS
announcement sent to the remote side (for instance to create a channel for debug
trace).

On the other side, the initial work requested by Bjorn seems to be reached:
de-correlate the control part to be able to reuse it for other rpmsg devices.

I just have the feeling that we are stay in the middle of the road without the
patches 4,5 and 6 to have a first basic interface relying on RPMsg.

My concern here is more about the complexity of using it by application, for
platforms that rely on virtio rpmsg transport. For instance applications need to
know the notion of local and remote RPMsg addressing.

Based on your feeling, here is my proposition for next steps:
 1- resend a version a version with only patch 1,2 3 + the patch to clean-up the
   #include in rpmsg_char
 2- switch back to the RPMsg TTY upstream.
 3- extend rpmsg_ctrl IOCTLs to allow instantiate RPMSG_TTY from Linux userland.


Then, we can come back to patches 4, 5 and 6 depending on the feedback from the
users.

Does this proposition would be OK for you?

Thanks,
Arnaud
