FWIW, imp-def-events are readily available for the existing Arm 
implementations[1][2], and annoyingly we could trivially synthesise an 
IIDR value from their imp-def PIDR registers if only we knew that that 
was valid to do in the first place. I feel tempted now to resurrect 
Jean-Philippe's DT binding and have a quick hack at that, then maybe a 
much longer think about how to attempt it for IORT...

Cheers,
Robin.
