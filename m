Can you be more specific please?

There is nothing like that. Even memory reserves are a finite resource
which can be consumed as it is sharing those reserves with other users
who are not necessarily coordinated. So before we start discussing
making this even more muddy by handing over memory reserves to the
userspace we should really examine whether pre-allocation is something
that will not work.

I do not think that handing over an unlimited ticket to the memory
reserves to userspace is a good idea. Even the in kernel oom killer is
bound to a partial access to reserves. So if we really want this then
it should be in sync with and bound by the ALLOC_OOM.

Could you elaborate some more on how this would be controlled from the
userspace? A dedicated syscall? A driver?

I would tend to agree.

A kernel module or eBPF to implement oom decisions has already been
discussed few years back. But I am afraid this would be hard to wire in
for anything except for the victim selection. I am not sure it is
maintainable to also control when the OOM handling should trigger.
