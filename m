Hi,

I saw that v2 (?) of this patch has made it into stable, which
is quite reasonable given the number of bug reports.
Are there any plans to "enhance" this patch once sufficient data
on controller support/drive combinations has been collected?

I didn't run any benchmarks to see whether performance has changed,
but I now have this on 5.14.6:

   /sys/class/ata_device/dev3.0/trim:forced_unqueued
   /sys/class/ata_device/dev4.0/trim:forced_unqueued

Before:

   /sys/class/ata_device/dev3.0/trim:queued
   /sys/class/ata_device/dev4.0/trim:queued

These correspond to 860 Pro and 860 Evo, connected to a X570
mainboard (AMD FCH controller).
Note that neither before nor after this commit I had any problems
with these drives.
