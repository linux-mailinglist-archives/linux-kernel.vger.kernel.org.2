I'd prefer we avoid this. It will break some of the semantics of the events
directory. One, only "user-events" will have this "marker" file. Although
it will be very similar to the "inject" file, but that's only for debugging
anyway.

All the files in the events directory is starting to add a bunch of
overhead, as they are typically copied into the instances. Although, when
we get the eventfs directory created, maybe that will not be as big of a
deal. But that still doesn't fix the semantics issue.
