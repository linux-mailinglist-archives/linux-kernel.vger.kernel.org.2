Doesn't rcutree.use_softirq imply rcuc is never woken, in which case
RCU_SOFTIRQ can't interrupt rcuc (e.g. while run atop an IRQ exit)?
I suppose during the (de)offload sequence we could have RCU_SOFTIRQ running
atop the NOCB CB kthread, but that's not something
rcu_is_callbacks_kthread() detects.

Also, why is rcu_is_callbacks_kthread() hardcoded to false for
!CONFIG_RCU_BOOST? Isn't it relevant for do_rcu_batch() ratelimiting
regardless (at least before your patches)?
