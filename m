The edge-triggered interrupt flag bits are usually cleared by writing 1 to 
the flag bit. Under this scheme, writing a 0 to a flag bit has no effect.

The assignment statement here is trying to clear bit 5 by writing 0. But 
what about the other bits that we're writing 0 to? Some of them may also 
be flag bits, and they may have been asserted in between the load and 
store. AFAICS this scheme just can't work for edge-triggered interrupts.

So perhaps this is a level-triggered interrupt?

Fair enough. Maybe we have found a bug in the MacOS IDE driver.

Thanks for your review.
