Looking at unix/linux naming convention and expectations for a desktop 
os, we see a simplification is called for, and toning out the 
fragmentation likeness. L- implies a fine granularity instead, and that 
you can do anything you want with this OS.

Going beyond the typical corporate mindset, which is really what many 
want in this days, and the answer to breaking up Microsoft in smaller 
parts. And really the lacking level of this OS. (Instead supporting 
school to the degree of going into the source oneself).

Serenity,
Ywe CÃ¦rlyn.
