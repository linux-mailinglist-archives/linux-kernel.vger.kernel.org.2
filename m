Before you mentioned business entities refrain from upstreaming recent
hardware. You question upstreaming not that recent, so basically
business entity will claim it has zero incentives working with upstream.

Actually there are incentives for both cases - better code quality for
the pieces being base for future devices, selling mainline supported
hardware to other businesses, eventually less work for themselves around
keeping code in sync with mainline. All these are of course difficult to
measure from business perspective.

Yes, I am specific because we talk here about specfic Kconfig changes
for one specific ARM sub-architecture. Same set of changes can be
applied to other SoCs and usually have more sense there because number
of upstream platforms is bigger.

If you have 10 different pinctrl drivers, you might decide to narrow the
defconfigs to subset of it. If you have 2-3, the extra complexity does
not matter and you just enable all of them. That's also decision we made
few years ago internally in Samsung.

I mentioned the less-contributing vendor arguments because you said:

>> Vendors are not able to upstream all functionality right away

That's the side-topic in this discussion.

Technically, all supported Exynos platforms require selecting
ARCH_EXYNOS and require all drivers selected by ARCH_EXYNOS. If you
mention some unsupported out-of-tree platforms, which I cannot
audit/see/use, it is not a valid reason to change statement above. Make
them supported, available to audit and check and statement above stops
being valid.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
