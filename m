I have a couple of questions. Let's suppose we have a two socket
system. Node 0 (DRAM+CPUs), Node 1 (DRAM+CPUs), Node 2 (PMEM on socket
0 along with Node 0) and Node 3 (PMEM on socket 1 along with Node 1).
Based on the tier definition of this patch series, tier_0: {node_0,
node_1} and tier_1: {node_2, node_3}.

My questions are:

1) Can we assume that the cost of access within a tier will always be
less than the cost of access from the tier? (node_0 <-> node_1 vs
node_0 <-> node_2)
2) If yes to (1), is that assumption future proof? Will the future
systems with DRAM over CXL support have the same characteristics?
3) Will the cost of access from tier_0 to tier_1 be uniform? (node_0
<-> node_2 vs node_0 <-> node_3). For jobs running on node_0, node_3
might be third tier and similarly for jobs running on node_1, node_2
might be third tier.

The reason I am asking these questions is that the statically
partitioning memory nodes into tiers will inherently add platform
specific assumptions in the user API.

Assumptions like:
1) Access within tier is always cheaper than across tier.
2) Access from tier_i to tier_i+1 has uniform cost.

The reason I am more inclined towards having numa centric control is
that we don't have to make these assumptions. Though the usability
will be more difficult. Greg (CCed) has some ideas on making it better
and we will share our proposal after polishing it a bit more.
