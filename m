Could you please spend few more words, on why calling the clock's 
set_rate() callback from the same clock's prepare callback is bad? I 
don't see how this would affect downstream clocks (as we do not change 
the frequency, we just set the registers).

The problem here is not about registration. PHY gets reset not just only 
on registration, it also might be powered off/reset later (e.g. when the 
DSI output is disabled for any reason). And during each of these resets 
we have to keep the PLL state. So keeping the state from the bootloaders 
seems also natural to me.

Yes, the continuous splash would be broken by resetting the PHY early.

Ah, we were safe here because the DSI driver first calls clk_set_rate, 
then clk_prepare_enable for the link clocks, which in turn makes VCO 
clock first receive the rate and then enable PLL.

I think we can not come with the better solution in the next day or two, 
we should merge your workaround. For now I'm trying to understand what 
are the alternatives and which of them can be better.

Also it's not about registers save/resore. We can add a call to 
recalc_rate to pll_save_state (as 14nm driver does).
