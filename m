Good thinking; DT was after all intended to be used as firmware shipping
on the device, when we're usually modifying and shipping it with the
kernel in the end.

Just to make sure other platforms aren't affected by these changes,
every board currently providing a "ref" clock has done so since the DSI
node was added, except these for these three patches that added them
after the fact:

    79e51645a1dd ("arm64: dts: qcom: msm8916: Set 'xo_board' as ref clock of the DSI PHY")
    6969d1d9c615 ("ARM: dts: qcom-apq8064: Set 'cxo_board' as ref clock of the DSI PHY")
    0c0e72705a33 ("arm64: dts: sdm845: Set 'bi_tcxo' as ref clock of the DSI PHYs")

Their commit-messages confuse me.  They make it seem like the "ref"
clock was previously used when this doesn't seem to be the case (hence
my patch).  Has there possibly been a patchset like mine that removed
the mentioned hardcoded clock, but ended up never being merged?

Either way, perhaps it's worth mentioning those patches with Fixes: so
that this commit can be backported (have to be careful that DT changes
for the other drivers are also backported, or this patch is split per
PHY file), and maybe it's worth cc-ing the original authors to ask for
clarification or at least make them aware?
