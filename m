I was slightly worries that the change would dump cx and mx from
whatever level the bootloader put it at down to LOW_SVS during boot.

But both rb3 and rb5 boots fine with this change, so I posted it here:

I took this into consideration in above patch, keeping track of the
first non-zero corner and using this when the domain is enabled.

Unfortunately, if the first entry would be say LOW_SVS power_off would
request corner (hlvl) 64. So I fixed that in patch 1/2 in above series.
