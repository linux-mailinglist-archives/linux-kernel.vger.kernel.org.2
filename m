Subject: RMS: If FSF is giving you trouble, recover the (C) using the 30 year
 statutory method and make a new entity.

Dear RMS: This if the FSF is giving you trouble, you could recover your 
copyrights using the 2nd method (the Statutory method), make a new 
foundation, or just a new corp entity, and transfer the copyright again 
to that new entity. A new corp entity costs 200 dollars. You can swing 
that, right? (The legal action vis a vis the copyright recovery takes 
considerably more)

---------------------------------------------------------------
(1st method, for those who have not transferred their copyrights)
(Linux, most OSS projects, those who ignored how RMS set things up and 
thought it was for no reason)

(2nd method, Statutory)
(For those who transferred their copyrights, and are now contending with 
a hostile takeover*)
(*this happens all the time with corps and foundations, you didn't 
expect it to happen to you?)
---------------------------------------------------------------
Additionally if you dislike that method and prefer a different method 
explicitly stated by Congress:
By statutory law, an author can recover any copyrights signed away after 
(+-)30 years (US Copyright act).

The design of a program etc is a copyrightable aspect. RMS fixed this in 
form 30 years ago.
