X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.17.1
In-Reply-To: <20211004160008.21645-1-andrew.kilroy@arm.com>
References: <20211004160008.21645-1-andrew.kilroy@arm.com>
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Add new armv8 common events for use by Arm Neoverse V1 cores in a later
commit. These are defined in the ArmV8 architecture reference manual
available from

  https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0487/gb/?lang=en
