As far as I'm aware, qcom did the lazy and ugly thing (as they usually do) and

decided to reuse previously-occupied IDs on newer kernel releases, where the legacy

PMICs weren't supported anymore. That's why some IDs have multiple candidates and unless

a better suggestion than "let's check if this 2013 PMIC+ 2019 SoC combo is sane" pops up, we

will probably just have to deal with ambiguity (for example `[20] PM8015/PM8998`).
