I am not sure Python could do that, maybe something else.

Parallelization is on the list of things to do.  Splitting by time is OK but gets trickier if you want to put the results back together in time order.  Also call chains get broken at the splits in time.

Often when I write a script it has to run in all kinds of weird environments that some random person installed, and it's not clear how portable building C will be there. And I doubt I can just copy the .so files around.

That is true.  .so files have limitations.

Right.  The documentation could definitely point out limitations and more user-friendly alternatives like using Python scripting.
