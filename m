Yes, to be clean, this would have to be a new primitive, not just an abused
local lock. It would just look similar to the RT version (a percpu array of
spinlocks), so for this patchset it would allow not to have two such locks
side be side (local + spin) while only one is being used. For maximum
flexibility the initialization would take a CONFIG_ (or something
compile-time bool) that when false would make the !RT version an empty
struct and "locking" would rely on preempt/irq disable (just as with !RT
local_lock). If compile-time true it would take a static key to decide on
boot whether the !RT version only does the preepmt/irq disable or actually
takes the lock.

But as you say below, it's too much complexity for questionable benefit.

But maybe this can all be avoided anyway, as I recalled what we do for
vmstat already (IIUC). See quiet_vmstat() - when cpu enters the nohz mode,
it flushes per-cpu vmstat diffs and then there's no reason to further
disturb the cpu to do that while it's on NOHZ mode. We could do the same for
lru pagevecs and pcplists?
