Expose an anon file descriptor interface to a command channel object
which allows user-space to send commands to the device by writing to
that file as well as consume device response messages by reading the
file.

When the file is released (closed), a channel shut-down sequence
starts. First, a message is sent to the device notifying it that the
channel is closing. Once the response to this message is received from
the device, the command channel object is destroyed.
