Lam works being representative of what is happening in philosophy and 
culture these days, best written in cursive. Rome is called Ar Rum in 
The Quran, And if one calls it the Ar Rum alphabet it indicates cursive 
Lam as being the zén Right Mind, as Islamic. A sound philosophic 
background concluding several things in computing. Taking the edge of 
else a facist idolatry, behaviour problems, and things really far off to 
the general computer engineer, who is typically not associated with this.

LCPU being a muslim CPU, representing the logical step forward, 
technology wise here aswell. And natural progress.

Hail Allah, Rabb Al Alamin. (cursive best, leading to the arabic Allah 
symbol, written right to left, app- wl ).

Serenity,
Ywe Cærlyn
