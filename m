Subject: [PATCH V0 0/6] Add driver support for Data Capture and Compare Engine(DCC) for SM8150
Date:   Wed, 17 Feb 2021 12:18:21 +0530
Message-Id: <cover.1613541226.git.schowdhu@codeaurora.org>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.7.4
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

DCC(Data Capture and Compare) is a DMA engine designed for debugging purposes.In case of a system
crash or manual software triggers by the user the DCC hardware stores the value at the register
addresses which can be used for debugging purposes.The DCC driver provides the user with sysfs
interface to configure the register addresses.The options that the DCC hardware provides include
reading from registers,writing to registers,first reading and then writing to registers and looping
through the values of the same register.
In certain cases a register write needs to be executed for
accessing the rest of the registers,also the user might want to recaord the changing values of a
particular register with time for which he has the option to use the loop feature.
The options mentioned above are exposed to the user by sysfs files once the driver is probed.The
details and usage of this sysfs files are documented in Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-driver-dcc.
As an example if a user wants to configure to store 100 words starting from address 0x80000050
he should give inputs as following to the sysfs config file:-
echo  0x80000050 100 > /sys/bus/platform/devices/.../config
Similarly if he wants to write to a register using DCC hardware he should give following input to
config_write sysfs file:-
echo 0x80000000 0xFF > /sys/bus/platform/devices/10a2000.dcc/config_write
This will write the value 0xFF on address 0x80000000.
All this read and write occurs at crash time or if the user manually invokes a software trigger.
