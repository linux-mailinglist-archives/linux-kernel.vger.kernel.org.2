That's rather sad, and does look very much like a hardware bug.

The question is what to do about it... there's Linus' "do not break
userspace" edict and that's exactly what this change has done. So I
suppose we're going to have to revert the change and put up with
everything being slightly slower on arm32 than it otherwise would
have been. That probably means we'll end up with almost every kernel
tree out there carrying a revert of the revert to work around the
fact that seemingly NXP broke their hardware - which itself is not
a good idea. I guess we're just going to have to put up with that.
