Should be out there now if you want to pull.

Why do you want/need this?  Having these changes in your tree is good,
but what about other coding style cleanups that I will end up applying
over time before the 5.12-rc1 merge window opens?  Are you wanting to
take the moved driver in your tree, or something else?

Traditionally moving drivers out of staging can be done 2 ways:
	- all happens in the staging tree, I take an ack from the
	  subsystem maintainer that this is ok to do.
	- A new driver enters the "real" subsystem tree, and then I
	  delete the driver in the staging tree.  This doesn't preserve
	  history as well (not at all), but can be easier for trees that
	  move quickly (like networking.)

Which ever works for you is fine with me, but relying on the code to
stay "not touched" in my tree after you pull it almost never happens due
to the number of drive-by coding style cleanups that end up in the
staging tree every week.
