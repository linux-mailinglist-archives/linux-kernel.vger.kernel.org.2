I am still digesting details and need to look deeper into how rstat
works but removing our own stats is definitely a good plan. Especially
when there are existing limitations and problems that would need fixing.

Just to check that my high level understanding is correct. The
transition is effectivelly removing a need to manually sync counters up
the hierarchy and partially outsources that decision to rstat core. The
controller is responsible just to tell the core how that syncing is done
(e.g. which specific counters etc). Excplicit flushes are needed when
you want an exact value (e.g. when values are presented to the
userspace). I do not see any flushes to be done by the core pro-actively
except for clean up on a release.

Is the above correct understanding?
