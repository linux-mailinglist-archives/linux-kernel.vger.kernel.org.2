No problem, thanks for the review!

A user events patch will get sent out soon, I'm finalizing some testing.
User events will register it's own dyn_event ops and allow users the
option to create, delete and view status of user events via the
dynamic_events tracefs file (in addition to the user mode IOCTL/ABI).

As probes attach to the user events the status of this is reflected in
dynamic_events, which makes it easy for admins to see why one is busy,
etc. It also makes it easy to verifying the system is working as
expected with just a terminal.

> BTW, how do you filter an event written by a user process?
> Will you add an array of event id for the file data structure?
The filtering would happen at the trace_event level, the only filtering
at the user event level is if a probe has been enabled on the underlying
trace_event or not. That is done via the shared page bits being cleared
or set. Bits are updated as probe un/registrations occur.

Users can advertise field values, offsets, etc as well as the print_fmt
in the newer ABI/patch based on the feedback from LPC2021. These land in
the trace_event fields and are viewable via tracefs like any other
evnet. I hope that is enough to light up the history feature of trace_event.
I am not familiar with it as much as you all.

Thanks,
