I'm really thinking about a nand-wide property now. Do you think it
makes sense to move the helper to the NAND core (instead of the raw
NAND core)? I'm fine only using it in the raw NAND core though.

Also, can I request a global s/sec/secure/ update? I find the "sec"
abbreviation unclear and I think we have more than enough cryptic
names :-)

Thanks,
Miqu√®l
