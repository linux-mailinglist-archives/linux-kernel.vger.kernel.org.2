The "&" thing was the wrong way around.  That part of CFI was Linux 
being sloppy, and the & part is a straight-up improvement.  Improvements 
can be invasive.  The problem with invasive code is when it invades 
places it doesn't belong.

So fundamentally, I think there's a sort of type system issue here, and 
it's more or less the same issue with IBT and with various fine-grained 
refinements to IBT.  Using syntax more or like what's been floating 
around this thread, the asm works like this:

[possible magic here depending on the precise scheme]
func.indirect:
  ENDBR (if it's an IBT build)
  [magic here?]

  [in a jump table scheme, there's a jmp here and possibly a large or 
negative gap.]

func:
  actual body

The point being that there's the actual function body (where one should 
*direct* jump to) and there's the address that goes in a C function 
pointer.  Indirect calls/jumps go to (or pretend to go to, depending on 
the scheme) func.indirect.

While one can plausibly kludge up the static call patching (and who 
knows what else -- eBPF, kprobes, mcount stuff, etc) using symbol-based 
hackery, I think we actually just want a way to convert from a function 
pointer to a function address.  It doesn't need to be fast, but it needs 
to work.  And I think this can probably be mostly done in plain C based 
on clang's implementation.  Ideally it would have a typecheck:

unsigned long __cfi_decode_funcpointer(funcptr type);

but that's not happening in plain C because I don't think there's a way 
to get the magic metadata.  But I bet we could do:

unsigned long __cfi_decode_funcpointer(funcptr val, funcptr ref)
{
   BUG_ON(ref and val aren't the same type);
   read insn bytes at val;
   return the jump target;
}

If this won't work with current clang, let's ask to get whatever basic 
functionality is needed to enable it.

<rambling>

Sadly, in clang, this is wrapped up in the incomprehensible "canonical" 
stuff.  I think that's a big mistake -- any sane ENDBR-using scheme 
would really prefer that ENDBR to be right next to the actual function 
body, and really any scheme would benefit due to better cache locality. 
But, more importantly, IMO any sane ENDBR-using scheme wants to generate 
the indirect stub as part of code gen for the actual function.  In an 
IBT build, this really doesn't deserve to work:

non-IBT C file generating:

func:
   ret

IBT-aware C file:

extern void func(void);
ptr = func;

clang has horrible magic to generate the indirect stub in the caller 
translation unit, and I think that's solving a problem that doesn't 
really need solving.  Sure, it's nifty, but it IMO should be opt-in, at 
least in a world where everyone agrees to recompile for CFI.  (Sure, 
using that hack for userspace IBT would be cute, and it would work.)

There's another tradeoff, though: errors like this are possible:

translation unit A:
void func(int)
{
   [body here]
}

translation unit B:
extern void func(char); /* wrong signature! */
ptr = func;
ptr();

The callee-generates-the-stub model will not catch this.  The 
caller-generates-the-stub model will.

In retrospect, we should have put our feet down with stack protector, 
though.  The problem with it was gcc hardcoding things that shouldn't 
have been hardcoded, and the gcc fixes were trivial.
