Curious, I had been looking into this, too.
And I have to side with Greg and Christian that your proposal should
already be possible today (cf device groups, which curiously has a
near-identical interface to what you proposed).
Also, I think that a generic 'device namespace' is too broad a scope;
some subsystems like net already inherited namespace support, and it
turns out to be not exactly trivial to implement.

What I'm looking at, though, is to implement 'block' namespaces, to
restrict access to _new_ block devices to any give namespace.
Case in point: if a container creates a ramdisk it's questionable
whether other containers should even see it. iSCSI devices are a similar
case; when starting iSCSI devices from containers their use should be
restricted to that container.
And that's not only the device node in /dev, but would also entail sysfs
access, which from my understanding is not modified with the current code.

uevent redirection would help here, but from what I've seen it's only
for net devices; feels a bit awkward to have a network namespace to get
uevents for block devices, but then I'll have to test.
And, of course, that also doesn't change the sysfs layout.

Cheers,

Hannes
