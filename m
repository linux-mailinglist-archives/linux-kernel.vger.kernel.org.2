The measurement unit in my example may not be rigorous and may confuse you.
What I mean is the batch processing can only gives each task fairness to
compete for this spinlock, but it can't reduce the wasted cpu cycles during
spinning waiting, no matter what the batch size is.  No matter what the
lock_batch is set, the following perf report won't change much. Many cpu
cycles are wasted on spinning. Other tasks running on the same cores will be
delayed, which is unacceptable for our latency-critical jobs. I'm trying to
find if it's possible to reduce the delay and the contention , after all,
59.50% is too high. This is why I post the thoughtless `cond_resched()`
approach.

Here is the perf report when executing ./usemem -j 4096 -n 20 10g -s 5

+   59.50%  usemem           [kernel.vmlinux]               [k] native_queued_spin_lock_slowpath
+    4.36%  usemem           [kernel.vmlinux]               [k] check_preemption_disabled
+    4.31%  usemem           [kernel.vmlinux]               [k] free_pcppages_bulk
+    3.11%  usemem           [kernel.vmlinux]               [k] release_pages
+    2.12%  usemem           [kernel.vmlinux]               [k] __mod_memcg_lruvec_state
+    2.02%  usemem           [kernel.vmlinux]               [k] __list_del_entry_valid
+    1.98%  usemem           [kernel.vmlinux]               [k] __mod_node_page_state
+    1.67%  usemem           [kernel.vmlinux]               [k] unmap_page_range

Agree. This is by no means the right way.

Yes. This may be the most reasonable way for now. I'm just trying my
best to find a slightly better way to reduce the wasted cpu time.
