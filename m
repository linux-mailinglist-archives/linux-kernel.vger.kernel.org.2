I really want the schedstats, which is very helpful to help us profile
thread-level latency.
The tracepoints is a bonus.

Pls. don't.
There are really use cases of statistics.
Our use case as follows,

Userspace Code Scope         Profiler

{
    user_func_abc();   <----      uprobe_begin() get the start statistics
    ...
    user_func_xyz();   <----       uprobe_end()  get the end statistics
}

Then with this profiler we can easily get what happened in this scope
and why its latency was great:
    scope_latency = Wait + Sleep + Blocked [1]  + Run (stime + utime)

If there is no schedstats, we have to trace the heavy sched::sched_switch.

[1]. With patch #5 and don't include sum_block_runtime in sum_sleep_runtime

There's no deadline task on our server, so I didn't support it for deadline.
But with this patchset, it is very easy to extend it to deadline and
any other sched classes.
