OK, great, your patch set uses the wrapper only in the necessary call
sites. Sorry, I overlooked this part.

Anyway, it knowingly does that. I considered either as equally harmful
side-ffects when I implemented. Either can only trigger, when there is a
bug in the kernel code.

It *could* do what that snippet suggest but it's like "out of the frying pan,
into the fire" kind of change.

Since NUMA patch set anyway requires to have a global dirty list, I think
the better way to deal with this, would be to declare a new global in the
patch under discussion:

static struct list_head sgx_dirty_list;

And sgx_encl_free_epc_page() could simply put the pages in this list. In
some cases you could possibly even reset the system state using kexec for
debugging purposes, so it could potentially bring a tiny bit of value.

I can rebase then my NUMA patches on top of SGX specific KVM patches, once
Boris have applied them.
