Subject: [PATCH 2/3] nvmem: core: Allow nvmem_cell_read_u16/32/64 to read smaller cells
Date:   Fri, 26 Feb 2021 16:26:02 -0800
Message-Id: <20210226162521.2.I7c9190630cf9131b42d521aa1c5b97135012a734@changeid>

The current way that cell "length" is specified for nvmem cells is a
little fuzzy. For instance, let's look at the gpu speed bin currently
in sc7180.dtsi:

  gpu_speed_bin: gpu_speed_bin@1d2 {
    reg = <0x1d2 0x2>;
    bits = <5 8>;
  };

This is an 8-bit value (as specified by the "bits" field). However,
it has a "length" of 2 (bytes), presumably because the value spans
across two bytes.

When querying this value right now, it's hard for a client to know if
they should be calling nvmem_cell_read_u16() or nvmem_cell_read_u8().
Today they must call nvmem_cell_read_u16() because the "length" of the
cell was 2 (bytes). However, if a later SoC ever came around and
didn't span across 2 bytes it would be unclear.  If a later Soc
specified, for instance:

  gpu_speed_bin: gpu_speed_bin@100 {
    reg = <0x100 0x1>;
    bits = <0 8>;
  };

...then the caller would need to change to try calling
nvmem_cell_read_u8() because the u16 version would fail.

Let's solve this by allowing clients to read a "larger" value. We'll
just fill it in with 0. If a client truly wants to know exactly how
big the cell was they can fall back to calling nvmem_cell_read()
directly.

NOTE: current implementation assumes that cells are little endian when
up-casting the size, but that's already pretty implicit in the way
nvmem works now anyway. See nvmem_shift_read_buffer_in_place(). Let's
document this but not do any auto-conversions just in case there was
an instance where someone was using this API to read big endian data
on a big endian machine and it happened to be working because there
was no bit offset.

I will freely admit that I always end up thinking in circles and
getting dizzy when I think too much about endian considerations. If
anyone has better intuition than I do and see that I've goofed this up
then please yell.
