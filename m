This is practically no different than the "white lie". I suppose you
could perhaps call it "more honest", if you want.

The point remains that unless we describe exactly which panel we're
dealing with, we ultimately have no way of properly quirking anything if
we ever have to. Also, once we allow this kind of wildcard we can
suddenly get into a situation where people might want to reuse this on
something that's not at all a google-pompom board because the same
particular power sequence happens to work on on some other board.

Similarly I can imagine a situation where we could now have the same
panel supported by multiple different wildcard compatible strings. How
is that supposed to be any cleaner than what we have now?

And I still keep wondering why bootloaders can't be taught about these
kinds of things. We have in the past discussed various solutions where
the bootloader could detect the type of panel connected and set the
proper compatible string.

If that's too complicated and these really are standardized interfaces
that work across a wide range of devices with perhaps a couple of
standard parameter, then introducing a standard connector type like
Rob Herring is suggesting makes more sense because that more properly
describes where exactly the standardization is going on (i.e. at the
interface level rather than the panel level).
