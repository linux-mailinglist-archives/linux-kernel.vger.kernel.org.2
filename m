It happens either one time during "device" probing (e.g. when connected
bluetooth UART device want to use higher baudrate) or when user
explicitly ask to change baudrate (e.g. when want to transfer files over
UART via x/y/z-modem / kermit protocol). Or maybe if somebody wants to
establish and use PPP network over UART. So it should not be a problem.

Looks like that changing baudrate not. But other places where this lock
is used (e.g. in clk callbacks) can be called from interrupt context.

But for baudrate change, I think it is not so common action, so there
should not be issue with slightly higher overhead.

This check was there also prior my patches. I only "extended" it to
match what is supported by this patch series.

I know. That is why I introduced code which recalculates divisors
registers to not change baudrate of UART2 during loading of UART1 and
also introduction of this clk subdriver with locks to prevent any
regressions.
