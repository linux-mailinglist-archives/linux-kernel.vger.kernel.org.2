Bjorn brought up the idea of just dropping the existing drm/msm/edp..
since the efforts to upstream the platform it worked on (8084?)
fizzled out, I don't think there is any device which uses it.

But it does sound like edp is a subset of the the newer dp driver, so
seems sort of like the better approach would be to add edp support to
dp.  I believe Bjorn has something based on this approach which is
working for sc8280 (although not sure if it is in shape to post
patches yet)
