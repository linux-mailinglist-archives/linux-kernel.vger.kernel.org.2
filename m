Yes, it works for me.

(Maybe 'onmatch(syscalls.sys_enter_open)' ?)

Let me confirm this, so eprobes can be attached to synthetic event?
IMHO, I rather like to prevent attaching eprobe_event on the other
dynamic events. It makes hard to check when removing the base dynamic
events...

For the above example, we can rewrite it as below to trace filename
without attaching eprobe_events on the synthetic event.

  echo 'my_open pid_t pid; char file[]' > synthetic_events

  echo 'e:myopen syscalls.sys_enter_open file=+0($filename):ustring' > dynamic_events
  echo 'e:myopen_ret syscalls.sys_exit_open ret=$ret' > dynamic_events
 
  echo 'hist:keys=common_pid:fname=file' > events/eprobes/myopen/trigger
  echo 'hist:keys=common_pid:fname=$fname:onmatch(eprobes.myopen).trace(my_open,common_pid,$fname)' > events/eprobes/myopen_ret

The point is that type converting or dereference pointer should be
done at the base event level, instead of synthetic event level.

Yes, so the discussion point is which link (->) we should reject.

- eprobe -> synthetic_event

or

- synthetic_event -> eprobe

I like to prohibit latter one. It is my feeling, but I think it is
natural that the eprobe is only for the static events, and I also think
dereferencing a pointer-type field in raw-event is more reliable than
dereferencing a digit value passed to the synthetic event.

Yes, anyway we need a way to find loops on histogram/eprobe at last.

You're welcome!
