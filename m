The reasons for choosing sysfs over ioctl is as follows


i) As can be seen from the sysfs attribute descriptions, most of it does 
basic hardware manipulations like dcc_enable, dcc_disable, config reset 
etc. As a result sysfs is preferred over ioctl as we just need to enter 
a 0 or 1
signal in such cases.

ii) Existing similar debug hardwares are there for which drivers have 
been written using sysfs interface. One such example is the 
coresight-etm-trace driver. Following is the link for reference

https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/trace/coresight/coresight-etm4x-reference.html
