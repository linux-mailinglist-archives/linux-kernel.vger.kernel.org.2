Thanks for sharing more details.

So, not only do we have a discoverable device that needs to be powered
on in a device specific way before probing, but in fact we have two
consumers of that "combo chip", one (PCIe) for Wifi and one (serdev)
for Bluetooth.

That sounds very similar to what we manage for the SDIO bus already.

We have a mmc pwrseq node to describe what resources that are needed
to power on/off the external chip. The driver for the functional
device (Wifi chip for example) may then call SDIO APIs provided by the
mmc core to power on/off the device, in case some kind of reset would
be needed.

Additionally, we have a child node below the mmc controller node,
allowing us to describe device specific things for the SDIO functional
device, like an out-of-band IRQ line for example.

Overall, this seems to work fine, even if the DT bindings may be questionable.

Don't get me wrong, I am not suggesting we should re-use the
mmc-pwrseq DT bindings - but just trying to share our experience
around them.

In the cases you describe, it certainly sounds like we need some kind
of minimal description in DT for these functional external devices.
For GPIO pins, for example.

How to describe this in DT is one thing, let's see if Rob can help to
point us in some direction of what could make sense.

When it comes to implementing a library/interface to manage these
functional devices, I guess we just have to continue to explore
various options. Perhaps just start simple with another subsystem,
like PCIe and see where this brings us.
