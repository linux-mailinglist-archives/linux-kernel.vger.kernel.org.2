Hello again after easter,


I have looked little bit more at sn65* driver and its application to 
have better background.

I miss only info what panel do you have, how it is enabled/power controlled.

Not true IMO, even if external device is powered on, you must enable 
EDID-reader logic.

I guess it is not uncommon to have different power states for EDID 
reading and bridge/panel pre-enablement (especially in embedded world). 
In fact there are setups where EDID-reader is totally different device 
than the bridge itself, and these devices should be 
powered/enabled/operational only for time of EDID reading.

Then drm_panel_get_modes will work then.

OK, it resembles to me DSI-controlled panel - to query/configure panel 
panel driver asks DSI-host to transfer some bytes to the panel and/or 
back via DSI-bus.

In case of eDP panels we could do similar thing to read edid - we call 
drm_panel_get_modes - it calls drm_panel_funcs.get_modes callback and it 
decides (based on DT) if it should fill modes according to hardcoded 
info into the driver or to ask the physical panel via DP-controller - 
this way all the players (the panel, AUX/DDC device) will know what to 
power-up.

I guess there is missing pieces - there is no DP bus :), I am not sure 
if there is straight way to access panel's aux/ddc from the panel 
driver, maybe somehow via drm_connector ???

Of course this only my idea - to be discussed with others.

Andrzej
