Subject: [PATCH v5 09/19] coresight: etm-perf: Allow an event to use different sinks

When a sink is not specified by the user, the etm perf driver
finds a suitable sink automatically, based on the first ETM
where this event could be scheduled. Then we allocate the
sink buffer based on the selected sink. This is fine for a
CPU bound event as the "sink" is always guaranteed to be
reachable from the ETM (as this is the only ETM where the
event is going to be scheduled). However, if we have a thread
bound event, the event could be scheduled on any of the ETMs
on the system. In this case, currently we automatically select
a sink and exclude any ETMs that cannot reach the selected
sink. This is problematic especially for 1x1 configurations.
We end up in tracing the event only on the "first" ETM,
as the default sink is local to the first ETM and unreachable
from the rest. However, we could allow the other ETMs to
trace if they all have a sink that is compatible with the
"selected" sink and can use the sink buffer. This can be
easily done by verifying that they are all driven by the
same driver and matches the same subtype. Please note
that at anytime there can be only one ETM tracing the event.

Adding support for different types of sinks for a single
event is complex and is not something that we expect
on a sane configuration.
