Unlikely.

That's it? There it just hangs? Not even printing something about tasks
getting stuck? Did you let it sit for a couple of (2-3) minutes to see
the task stuck warnings?

What's weird though is that this is evidently with mac80211 - so
certainly all the patches I just sent out will do nothing for you, and
something else is strange, because mac80211 I've definitely not just
reviewed but also tested these code paths many times.

Hmm. But yeah, either way, a lockdep report or stack dump will surely
help. Perhaps something in the ath* driver you're using that I missed.
