Could you be more specific on how this can happen without your patch? I
have to say I haven't realized this side effect when discussing it.

I will be honest that I am not really happy about pagefault_out_of_memory.
I have tried to remove it in the past. Without much success back then,
unfortunately[1]. 
Maybe we should get rid of it finally. The OOM is always triggered from
inside the allocator where we have much more infromation about the
allocation context. A first step would be to skip pagefault_out_of_memory
for killed or exiting processes.

[1] I do not have msg-id so I cannot provide a lore link but google
pointed me to https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg1400402.html
