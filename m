Hi, Ming

There are two problems here in nbd, both reported by our syzkaller.

The first is that blk_mq_tag_to_rq() returned a freed request, which is
because tags->static_rq[] is freed without clearing tags->rq[].
Syzkaller log shows that a reply package is sent to client without
the client's request package. And this patch is trying to solve this
problem.

The second is that flush_end_io() decrement it's refcount to -1. I guess
this is because nbd_clear_que concurrent with normal completion /
timeout / error handling, and somehow trigger the problem.
However I'm still trying to understand the logic in nbd. I tried to
add a check in flush_end_io() to fix this, as you replied, it's
driver's responsibility to fix the problem.

It seems that the two problems are not related. And this patch is ok
to fix the first problem. Any suggestions?

Thanks
