Does get_user_pages() actually end up calling set_pte_at() normally? If
not then on the normal user_mem_abort() route although we can easily
check VM_MTE_TAG_INIT there's no obvious place to hook in to ensure that
the pages actually allocated have the PG_mte_tagged flag.

I'm also not sure how well this would work with the MMU notifiers path
in KVM. With MMU notifiers (i.e. the VMM replacing a page in the
memslot) there's not even an obvious hook to enforce the VMA flag. So I
think we'd end up with something like the sanitise_mte_tags() function
to at least check that the PG_mte_tagged flag is set on the pages
(assuming that the trigger for the MMU notifier has done the
corresponding set_pte_at()). Admittedly this might close the current
race documented there.

It also feels wrong to me to tie this to a process with prctl(), it
seems much more normal to implement this as a new mprotect() flag as
this is really a memory property not a process property. And I think
we'll find some scary corner cases if we try to associate everything
back to a process - although I can't instantly think of anything that
will actually break.

The latest series uses pfn_to_online_page() to reject ZONE_DEVICE early.

Agreed.
