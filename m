OK, in that case,

Hmm, I got it. I think it should be optional, and only for the types
which has "struct" prefix. Basic types like char, int, long etc should
keep the size as it is.

The __data_loc (and __rel_loc) is a bit special type attribute, which is
required for "parsing" the trace buffer entry. Thus it is used also in the
libtraceevent (and perf tools to pass the parsed event to python/perl script).
Let me add the __rel_loc support.

I mean the several isolated patches which commit to the same file.
(like upgrading it step by step.) You can make it a series.

Yes, you can put the test in the end of the series :)

The series usually merged at once :) I just asked you to break it
down to the several patches, so that I can review and discuss on
each feature in different threads.

Hmm, I see. In that case, the user process should not use such types because
other analysis tool will run as a 64-bit process.
(For example, for this reason kprobe event doesn't use 'int' or 'long' type,
 but only allow 'u32', 's64' etc.)

Or, as I said, you can pass the size when it has "struct" prefix. :)
The __rel_loc and __data_loc is usually used for storing arrays, especially
dynamic size array like null terminated string. But of course you can use
it for storing a big data structure.
Let's check how the libtraceevent(tools/lib/traceevent) parses the recorded
data.

OK, the 'print_fmt' in 'format' file will show how the trace entry will be
printed in the trace buffer (in human readable style). But that is not
done automatically. You have to write the corresponding printout function
for the event. This means that user-specific format needs to be verified
and you need a programmable printout function. This is why it is hard to
support the custom data structure in ftrace.
Anyway, I think you'd better to start without this option. (and please
start with describing how the user-event arguments are shown in trace
buffer.)

Would you mean the event with this flag is only available from eBPF?

Actually, as other dynamic events do, user can remove only by name, or
specifically with the arguments. So argument check is optional but
if user specified it, we should verify it.

I see that you want to fix the processor id, but preempt_disable()
section should be minimum as possible and should not involve the
function which can access to user memeory.

Hmm, that's strange, because copy_from_iter(user) may cause a fault
and yielded. Isn't it an iovec?

They are rare, but possibly the process is yielded if it is under heavy
memory pressure. I recommend you to copy the user write data in the stack
or thread-local buffer at once and pass it to probe functions. That is
safe way.

So, can you make it something like below?;

/* Copy event from user space */
copy_from_iter(&idx, sizeof(idx), i);
buf_len = copy_from_iter(local_buf, i->count, &i);

/* loop on recording functions */
preempt_disable();
user_event = get_user_event(file, idx);
if (user_event && user_event_is_enabled(user_event)) {
	user_event_for_each_probe_func(user_event, probe_func, tpdata) {
		probe_func(user_event, thread_buf, buf_len, tpdata);
	}
}
preempt_enable();

Anyway, it should be limited. You can not write more than 1 page, and
do you really need it? And allocating kmalloc object is relatively low
cost compared with a system call.

BTW, I recommend you to use a different name for this reference counter,
e.g. refcnt, since refs is used for "file-local reference user event tables".

Hmm, OK. So the events are not serialized, multiple threads can write the
events concurrently. Got it.

No not required, the "event_mutex" prevents other user from invoking
the user_events_ref_add(), thus the "file->private_data" will not be
updated from others. Thus you don't need to care the scenario of
"file->private_data" is changed between dereference and reassign it.
I think what you need is "lockdep_assert_held(&event_mutex)" in the
user_events_ref_add().

OK, I understand why you need to use RCU at least reader part. For the
updater part, you don't need the preemption disabled but need a mutex.
(And when closing a file, the fd is already invalidated.)
