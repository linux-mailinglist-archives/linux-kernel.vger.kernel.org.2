Hmm... I'm not sure how to align your diagnosis with the symptoms in
the bug report.  If we were limited by memory, that should slow down
the I/O, but we should still be making forward progress, no?  And a
forced reboot should not result in data corruption, unless maybe there
was a missing check for a failed memory allocation, causing data to be
written to the wrong location, a missing error check leading to the
block or file system layer not noticing that a write had failed
(although again, memory exhaustion should not lead to failed writes;
it might slow us down, sure, but if writes are being failed, something
is Badly Going Wrong --- things like writes to the swap device or
writes by the page cleaner must succeed, or else Things Would Go Bad
In A Hurry).
