In the particular case this patch is fixing for me, the frontends are =
the Windows XENVBD driver and the Windows crash version of the same =
driver (actually built from different code). The 'normal' instance is =
multi-page aware and the crash instance is not quite, i.e. it uses the =
old ring-ref but knows to clean up 'ring-page-order'.
Clearly, in a crash situation, we cannot rely on frontend to clean up so =
what you say does highlight that there indeed needs to be a second patch =
to xen-blkback to make sure it removes 'ring-page-order' itself as =
'state' cycles through Closed and back to InitWait. I think this patch =
does still stand on its own though.
