I understand the problem and it is a very crappy situation.

Could we make this a little bit clever with something like this:
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.13-rc7/source/drivers/mtd/nand/raw/nand_micron.c#L434

This is far from ideal, there should definitely be a change in the DT.
But given your initial comments I guess it is not possible.

Anyway I don't find a better way as, during the attach() call, we don't
yet ran the manufacturer code, hence we don't know if on-die ECC is
actually available or not.

Thanks,
Miqu√®l
