Yes, very strange. After a closer look to fs/seq_file.c, especially
seq_read_iter(), it seems that op->next will only be called when m->count == 0,
at least in the first while(1) loop. Printing "No data\n" sets m->count
to 8, so it will continue after Fill:, then call op->next, which returns NULL
and breaks the second while(1) loop, and also calls op->stop. Then it returns
from seq_read_iter(), only to be called again, and again, ...

Only when op->start returns NULL it will end it for good, probably
because seq_read_iter() will then return 0 instead of 8. Not sure if
there is a better way to fix this than by adding a second "return NULL"
to op->start, which feels a bit awkward and makes you wonder why the
"return NULL" from op->next is not enough.

Ah ok, I wasn't sure about the "t->count > 0" case, i.e. if the check for
"*ppos > t->count" would still be correct there. So apparently it wouldn't,
and we need two checks, like you suggested

That should be return NULL here, right?

Will send a new patch, unless I find a better way after investigating the
endless seq_read_iter() calls mentioned above.
Is there an easy way to test the "t->count > 0" case, i.e. what would need
to be done to get some other reply than "No data"?
