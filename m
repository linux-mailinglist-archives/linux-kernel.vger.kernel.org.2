This is true. An emulated CMOV is almost 50 times slower than 
conditional branch on my Vortex86MX.

However, in practice this results in very little slowdown - GCC seems to 
really avoid emitting CMOVs, preferring conditional branches instead, so 
applications are still completely useable.

While it is true that Ubuntu has dropped support for 32 bit devices, 
Debian, OpenSUSE and many others don't seem to plan on doing so anytime 
soon.

These SoCs are not the average ARM-based SoC used in very high volume 
products such as WiFi routers where you want a million of units all 
executing the same thing. For those I totally agree you'd use a fully 
customized operating system on a build root image.

Vortex86 devices are on the other hand used generally in low-volume, 
niche applications, where the premium of a x86-compatible Vortex86 
device that can boot any standard x86 operating systems and applications 
is preferrable to the cost of developing a fully customized operating 
system image.

I've seen such devices used by small companies to develop point of sale 
machines, information screen, kiosks, etc... where they benefit from 
being easy to set up and, being a standard operating system, allow 
easily tweaking to the customer's needs.

Myself, I am using an eBox 3350MX-AP (which sports a Vortex86MX with 
512MB of RAM) as a small, low-power web server running Debian sid. If I 
were to use buildroot, I'd lose completely the ability to install new 
features or apply updates without having to rebuild the entire image, 
which is a complex and time-consuming task.
