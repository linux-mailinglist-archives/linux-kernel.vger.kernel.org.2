Right. I'm not sure things could be described any better right now. If
we need to change this to be MDSS_GDSC power domain and control the
level of the parent then I suppose we'll have to make some sort of DT
change and pair that with a driver change. Maybe if that happens we can
just pick a new compatible and leave the old code in place.

Are you happy enough with this current patch?

Presumably the opp table node name can be 'opp-table' as long as it
lives under the node that's using it. If the opp table is at / or /soc
then it will need to be unique. I'd prefer just 'opp-table' if possible.
