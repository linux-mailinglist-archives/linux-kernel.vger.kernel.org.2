Right, I mean it is _effectively_ an indirect call in the sense that the
call destination is under the control of a writable memory location.
Yes, static_call_update() must be called to make the change, hence why I
didn't wave my arms around when static_call was originally added. It's a
net benefit for the kernel: actual indirect calls now become updatable
direct calls. This means reachability becomes much harder for attackers;
I'm totally a fan. :)

Right -- though wouldn't just adding __ro_after_init do the same?

DEFINE_STATIC_CALL(static_call_name, func_a) __ro_after_init;

If you wanted the clean WARN_ON, __static_call_update() could check if
the struct static_call_key is in a non-writable region.

Both have a meaningful lack of exposure to common attacker-reachable
code paths (e.g., it's likely rare that there are ways attackers can
control the target/content of a text_poke_bp(): alternatives and ftrace,
both of which tend to use read-only content).

static_call_update() is limited per-site with a fixed set of hardcoded
targets (i.e. any place static_call() is used), but the content
is effectively arbitrary (coming from writable memory). AIUI, it's
intended to be used more widely than text_poke_bp(), and it seems like
call sites using static_call_update() will become less rare in future
kernels. (Currently it seems mostly focused on sched and pmu, which
don't traditionally have much userspace control).

So, they're kind of opposite, but for me the question is for examining
the changes to reachability and what kind of primitives their existence
provides an attacker. IMO, static_calls are a net gain over indirect
calls (from some usually writable function pointer) because it becomes
a direct call. It's risk doesn't match a "real" direct call, though,
since they do still have the (much more narrow) risk of having something
call static_call_update() from a writable function pointer as in your
example, but that's still a defensively better position than an regular
indirect call.

What I'm hoping to see from static_calls is maybe defaulting to being
ro_after_init, and explicitly marking those that can't be, which makes
auditing easier and put things into a default-safe state (i.e. both
fixed targets and fixed content).

Well, sure, it's inefficient, not _broken_. :) And can you point to the
"use static_calls because CFI is slow" discussion? I'd be curious to read
through that; the past performance testing had shown that CFI performance
overhead tends to be less than the gains of LTO. So compared to a "stock"
kernel, things should be about the same if not faster.

That said, I understand I'm talking to you, and you're paying very close
attention to the scheduler, etc. :) I'm sure there are specific
workloads that look terrible under CFI!

Right, I know. That's why I'm saying that I see these features as
certainly related, but not at odds with each other. CFI doesn't protect
static_call sites, but static_call sites are already more well protected
than their earlier indirect calls.

The only note I had was that if static_call wants to dig into the jump
table, it likely needs to static_call-specific: we don't want a general
way to do that without knowing we have some reasonable bounds on the
behavior of the code using it. I think it's fine to have static_calls
do this, though it'd be nice if they could be a little more defensive
(generally) at the same time.
