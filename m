Possibly. But it is the same situation: it probably has a long
history. And it may even make some sense. The obvious trigger for
doing the conditional initialization for modern is the setting of
FEATURES_OK. The problem is, legacy doesn't do FEATURES_OK. So we would
need a different trigger.

I.e. the hack does not work for transitional vhost-user devices,
but it doesn't break them either.

Furthermore, I believe there is not much we can do to support
transitional devices with vhost-user and similar, without extending
the protocol. The transport specific detection idea would need a new
vhost-user thingy to tell the device what has been figured
out, right?

In theory modern only could work, if the backends were paying extra
attention to endianness, instead of just assuming that the code is
running little-endian.

Agree. For example config is native endian ATM AFAICT. 

> What about other backends though?

I think whenever the config is owned and managed by the vhost-backend
we have a problem with transitional. And we don't have everything in
the protocol to deal with this problem.

I didn't check modern for the different vhost-user backends. I don't
think we recommend our users on s390 to use those. My understanding
of the use-cases is far form complete.

I agree.

I'm fine with either of these as a quick fix, but we will eventually have
to find a solution. AFAICT this solution works for the s390 setups we
care about the most, but so would a revert.

You mean a feature bit? I think it is a good idea even if
it weren't strictly necessary. We will have a behavior change
for some devices, and I think the ability to detect those
is valuable.

Your spec change proposal, makes it IMHO pretty clear, that
we are changing our understanding of how transitional should work.
Strictly, transitional is not a normative part of the spec AFAIU,
but still...

I'm fine either way. The extra exit is only for the initialization and
one per 1 device, I have no feeling if this has a measurable performance
impact.

I thin we established how this should be in the future, where a transport
specific mechanism is used to decide are we operating in legacy mode or
in modern mode. But with the current QEMU reality, I don't think so.
Namely currently the switch native-endian config -> little endian config
happens when the VERSION_1 is negotiated, which may happen whenever
the VERSION_1 bit is changed, or only when FEATURES_OK is set
(vhost-user).

This is consistent with device should detect a legacy driver by checking
for VERSION_1, which is what the spec currently says.

So for transitional we start out with native-endian config. For modern
only the config is always LE.

The guest can distinguish between a legacy only device and a modern
capable device after the revision negotiation. A legacy device would
reject the CCW.

But both a transitional device and a modern only device would accept
a revision > 0. So the guest does not know for ccw.

I can take the new description without any changes if you like. I care
more about getting a decent fix, than a perfect patch description. Should
I send out a non-RFC with that implements the proposed changes?

I believe  drv->probe(dev) is called after the real finalize, so
that access should be fine or?

Don't we just have to look out for verify?

Isn't the problematic commit fe36cbe0671e ("virtio_net: clear MTU when
out of range")?

The problem with commit 14de9d114a82a is that the device won't know,
the driver didn't take the advice (for the MTU because it deemed its
value invalid). But that doesn't really hurt us.

On the other hand with fe36cbe0671e we may deem a valid MTU in the
config space invalid because of the endiannes mess-up. I that case
we would discard a perfectly good MTU advice.

> I think that's all, but pls double check me.


Looks good!
$ git grep -e '\.validate' -- '*virtio*'
drivers/block/virtio_blk.c:     .validate                       = virtblk_validate,
drivers/firmware/arm_scmi/virtio.c:     .validate = scmi_vio_validate,
drivers/net/virtio_net.c:       .validate =     virtnet_validate,
drivers/virtio/virtio_balloon.c:        .validate =     virtballoon_validate,
sound/virtio/virtio_card.c:     .validate = virtsnd_validate,

But only blk and net access config space from validate.
