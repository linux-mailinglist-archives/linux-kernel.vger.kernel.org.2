The event counting threshold's purpose is to limit the *rate*  of event update.  The
side effect is we will miss some update by the sampling nature.  However, we can't
afford to let the sampling go to frequent or the overhead will be too much.

The forced update makes sure that a needed update happens 
to put the memcg on the tree happens and we don't allow the
memcg to escape page reclaim even if the update happens relatively rarely.  Lowering
the threshold does not guarantee that the update happens, resulting in a runaway
memcg.  The forced update and threshold serves different purpose. In my opinion
the forced update is necessary.  We can keep the update overhead low with
low update rate, and yet make sure that a needed update happens.  I think both
are necessary for proper function.  The overhead from the forced update
is negligible and I don't a downside adding it.
