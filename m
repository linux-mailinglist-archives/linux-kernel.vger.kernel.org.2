You are right.

In the old code we used to have
2*(MEMCG_NR_STAT + NR_VM_EVENT_ITEMS + MEM_CGROUP_NTARGETS) (2 struct
memcg_vmstats_percpu) pcp data plus MEMCG_NR_STAT + NR_VM_EVENT_ITEMS
atomics.

New code has 2*MEMCG_NR_STAT + 2*NR_VM_EVENT_ITEMS + MEM_CGROUP_NTARGETS
in pcp plus 2*MEMCG_NR_STAT + 2*NR_VM_EVENT_ITEMS aggregated
counters.

So the resulting diff is MEMCG_NR_STAT + NR_VM_EVENT_ITEMS - MEM_CGROUP_NTARGETS * nr_cpus

which would be 1024 - 2 * nr_cpus. Which looks better.

Thanks and sorry for misreading the patch.
