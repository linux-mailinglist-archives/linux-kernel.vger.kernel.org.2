The ksm argument to this function isn't actually used.

Also the comment should be fixed to be something like "Return the largest data
unit size that is compatible with the given request queue.".

Can this comment be made more concise and less confusing?  Something like:

	Checks whether any of @ksm's crypto capabilities are compatible with the
	request_queue, and if so, clears any incompatible capabilities from @ksm
	and assigns @ksm to the request_queue.

	Return: %true if @ksm was assigned to @q, or %false if it was not (due
	        to none of @ksm's crypto capabilities being compatible with @q)

There's no need for the parenthesis around ~dus_allowed_mask.

Is there a better way to get the queue/disk name?  Also, device names normally
go at the very beginning of the messages, like "%s: <message>".

This message is also very long; something more concise would be good.  Maybe:

"%s: only allowing crypto data unit sizes up to %lu bytes due to device limitations\n"
