This patch was merged in linux 4.16 and thus is on the 4.16.y
stable branch and it was backported to stable 4.14.y. It would
make sense to Cc: stable # v4.14 also, but...

> Fixes: 112665286d08 ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Context tracking exit guest context before enabling irqs")

... this one, which was merged in linux 5.12, was never backported
anywhere because it wasn't considered as a fix, as commented here:

https://lore.kernel.org/linuxppc-dev/1610793296.fjhomer31g.astroid@bobo.none/

AFAICT commit 61bd0f66ff92 was never mentioned anywhere in a bug. The
first Fixes: tag thus looks a bit misleading. I'd personally drop it
and Cc: stable # v5.12.

Change looks ok but it might be a bit confusing for the
occasional reader that guest_enter_irqoff() isn't matched
by a guest_exit_irqoff().

Maybe add a comment like in x86 ?

Same remarks. FWIW a followup was immediately added to x86 to
encapsulate the enter/exit logic in common helpers :

    KVM: x86: Consolidate guest enter/exit logic to common helpers

This makes the code nicer. Maybe do something similar for POWER ?
