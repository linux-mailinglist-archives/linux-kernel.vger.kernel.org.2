It's the middle of the merge window, I can't accept anything right
now...

But this doesn't even look like it is in my "to review" queue anymore,
which means that there must have been a lot of discussion on it and
others asking for changes, so why not work on that right now while you
can and resubmit it when you have done that?

No need to ever wait on me for fixing things up.
