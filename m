I NEED YOUR IMMEDIATE REPLY

HELLO DEAR

 My Name is Mrs. Debby Hallcom, from Norway. I know that this message
will  be a surprise to you. Firstly, I am married to Mr.Smith Hallcom,
A gold merchant who owns a small gold Mine in Burkina Faso; He died of
Cardiovascular Disease in mid-March 2011. During his life time he
deposited the sum of ($12,500,000.000, dollars.) with my name as the
legal rightful appointed beneficiary to the fund in a bank in
Ouagadougou the capital city of Burkina Faso in West Africa.The
deposited money was from the sale of the shares, death benefits
payment and entitlements of my deceased husband by his company.

  I am sending this message to you praying that it will reach you in
good health, since I am not in good health condition in which I sleep
every night without knowing if I may be alive to see the next day. I
am suffering from long time cancer and presently i am partially
suffering
from a stroke illness which has become almost impossible for me to
move around. I am married to my late husband for over 4 years before
he died and is unfortunately that we don't have a child, my doctor
confided in me that i have less chance to live. Having known my health
condition, I decided to contact you to claim the fund since I don't
have any relation I grew up from the orphanage home, I have decided to
donate what I have to you for the support of helping Motherless
babies/Less privileged/Widows' because I am dying and diagnosed of
cancer for about 2 years ago. I have been touched by God Almighty to
donate from what I have inherited from my late husband to you for good
work of God Almighty. I have asked Almighty God to forgive me and
believe he has, because He is a Merciful God I will be going in for an
operation surgery soon
.This is the reason i need your services to stand as my next of kin or
an executor to claim the funds for charity purposes. If this money
remains unclaimed after my death, the bank executives or the
government will take the money as unclaimed fund and maybe use it for
selfish and worthless ventures, I need a very honest person who can
claim this money and use it for Charity works, for orphanages, widows
and also build schools for less privilege that will be named after my
late husband and my name.I need your urgent answer to know if you will
be able to execute this project, and I will give you more information
on how the fund will be transferred to your bank account.

Thanks
Mrs. Debby Hallcom.
