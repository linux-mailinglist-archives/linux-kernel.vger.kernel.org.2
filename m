Thank you for explanation. I would love to receive kind of guidance,
best practices, guide for future patches. I will them write it down and
try to follow during my review. However it made me a sad that a patch,
adhering in my mind to all rules, was postponing the pull request.

Good summary, thanks Arnd. I would like to add that the discussed change
was bringing a new compatible. It was saying: hey, this hardware so far we
treated as old one, but it's not, sorry, it is different, so here you
have a new compatible with a change in few properties as well (and new
bindings which appeared a release earlier).

Best regards,
Krzysztof
