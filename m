"hands over" -> "fallback"

Please write in imperative form, e.g. "Change...", or perhaps in this
case "Look...".=20

Hopes are somewhat irrelevant, in the context of a commit message.

Neither hopes nor doubts help us :-)

Because the commit message did not discuss any of the code changes
that were done it is very hard to say much anything of this yet.

There's also one corner case that was not discussed in the commit
message.

The historical reason for not using TPM2 file is that old TPM2's
did not have that feature. You have to ensure that legacy hardware
does not break.
