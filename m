The display hardware blocks are powered by the MDSS_GDSC power-domain,
which is a subdomain to the MMCX power domain.

MDSS_GDSC is controlled by registers in the display clock controller
block, which is also powered by the MMCX power domain.

Lastly the MMCX power domain is controlled through the RPMh, using the
rpmhpd driver.



As such, specifying MMCX as the power-domain for the dispcc block and
making the dispcc driver use that same power-domain as parent for the
MDSS_GDSC seems to accurately depict these relationships.
