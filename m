Does that mean the decoders in eprobes/histogram don't check event
record sizes before accessing the data? Shouldn't that get fix
centrally? That would mean a loaded module could do the same thing
(user_events only works if the user has access to tracefs, so it's not
like it's open to all users).

Is it possible to mark trace_events with a flag that says "don't trust
this"? That way eBPF, ftrace and perf would still allow recording and
decoding offline (in a safer context).

From user_events code, an entry is always allocated with enough data and
if it fails (either too big or alloc failure) the event is not written
out. This appears to be purely in the decode logic that is not within
this patch?

Thanks,
