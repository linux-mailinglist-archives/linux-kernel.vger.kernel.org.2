Thanks. We use a workqueue to perform asynchronous reclaim for cgroups.
The kworker may consume lots of CPU cycles if the cgroup memory pressure
is extremely high, so we want to charge the cpu usage to the related
cgroup for which the kworker works. Otherwise, the reclaim kworker will
steal cpu time from the system level, which breaks the resource isolation.

Yes, our work is very similar to Johannes'.

I also found that you posted a patchset in 2019 to introduce a
cgroup-aware workqueue. In that discussion, back-charging is considered
to be a suitable solution.
    https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190611195549.GL3341036@devbig004.ftw2.facebook.com/

I also have a question here. Are the back-charging and remote charging
the same thing?

This is indeed a problem. Neither cgroup-aware kthread nor remote
charging can address this. Maybe this is the biggest obstacle hindering
fine-grained charging.

Sorry. Is this a typo? It seems the word "known" should be "unknown"...
