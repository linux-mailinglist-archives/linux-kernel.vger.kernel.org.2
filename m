Subject: [PATCH 01/23] tty: finish kernel-doc of tty_struct members
Date:   Fri, 26 Nov 2021 09:15:49 +0100
Message-Id: <20211126081611.11001-2-jslaby@suse.cz>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.34.0
In-Reply-To: <20211126081611.11001-1-jslaby@suse.cz>
References: <20211126081611.11001-1-jslaby@suse.cz>

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

There are already pieces of kernel-doc documentation for struct
tty_struct in tty.h. Finish the documentation for the members which were
undocumented yet.

It also includes tuning the already existing pieces like flow and ctrl,
especially adding highlights to them.
