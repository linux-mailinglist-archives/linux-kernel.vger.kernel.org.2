That sounds better to me :-)

Hmm ... if the start of a bio is not aligned to the physical block size
I don't think that the block layer can do anything about the start of
the bio. Anyway, I have taken a quick look at this patch series and the
patch series looks pretty clean to me. I will let Christoph review this
patch series since he already reviewed the previous version of this series.

Bart.
