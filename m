Then this shouldn't be added in first place... :/

But client can be unloaded during M0 event!

Anyway, I don't think the deadlock scenario is valid because of the usage
of "read_lock_bh()". So if "mhi_send_cmd()" has acquired
"spin_lock_bh(&mhi_cmd->lock)", it can always acquire
"read_lock_bh(&mhi_cntrl->pm_lock)" as multiple readers can acquire the
read lock.

Deadlock would only occur if one of the functions take write lock.

Thanks for auditing.
