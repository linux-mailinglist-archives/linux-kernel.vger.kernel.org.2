Hello,

I apologize for delayed reply.

The system in question runs in a firmware that tries to achieve
complete W^X protection. Both loader code and loader data
are not executable, so the suggested approach does not work.
If you would like to test this, you can set
the PcdDxeNxMemoryProtectionPolicy in any firmware available to you.

As a justification for the approach itself, I can use the fact that
UEFI specification says nothing about the ability to execute
self-allocated EfiLoaderCode or any other types besides the areas
allocated by the firmware for UEFI Images. In fact, Table 7-5
explicitly states that EfiLoaderCode is used for:

> The code portions of a loaded UEFI application.

While we do not think it should be interpreted as one cannot allocate
such areas at all, it is clear that there are no guarantees about the
other use cases and permissions of the allocations of this type besides
those stated by 2.3.4:

> Paging mode is enabled and any memory space defined by the UEFI memory
> map is identity mapped (virtual address equals physical address),
> although the attributes of certain regions may not have all read,

> protection.

Long story short, the kernel is not allowed to allocate such areas and
assume they are executable, it should do paging itself, and the changes
here address that. For the reference, Windows adheres to this convention
and works fine on the target system.

Thanks,
Baskov Evgeniy
