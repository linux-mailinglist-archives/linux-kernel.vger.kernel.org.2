I see where are you coming from now. (Perhaps I'd suggest
allocating/prioritizing the allowances on the hosting side. If simply
wrapping "everything" into a non-root cgroup is not enough.)

Good point, That's IMO a better idea, it'd be more consistent with other
resources for which there exist global (cgroup independent) kernel
constraints (e.g. threads-max sysctl, mem= cmdline, cpu hotplug) that
double the root cgroup contraint role.

OTOH, this also deepens the precedent of init NS root cgroup being
special (more special than a container's root cgroup).
