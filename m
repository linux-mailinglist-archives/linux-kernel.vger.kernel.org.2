The members from the Linux distributions that are on copy on this may tell you 
a different story. They all developed their own downstream patches to somehow 
add the flexibility that is needed for them. So, we have a great deal of 
fragmentation at the resting-foundation of Linux cryptography.

Then the implementation of the flexibility in the LRNG is done such that 
irrespecitve of which options are selected, the LRNG operates always at a 
secure state.

I have received numerous technical comments from various Linux developers. All 
were integrated. None of these comments hinted to requestes in changing the 
design.

That said, even when you refer to already suggested architectural differnces, 
I yet have to first receive them,
