trace events can always add fields, it's removing them that can cause
problems (but even then, it's not that bad). The new libtracefs and
libtraceevent make it trivial for tools to get the fields from trace events
when needed.

It is also trivial with the libraries to write a tool that can put together
everything you want. We even are working on python bindings to connect to
these libraries where you could write a python script to do this.

There is no need for a new tracepoint, especially if it makes it harder to
improve the implementation of what is being traced.

As you should.
