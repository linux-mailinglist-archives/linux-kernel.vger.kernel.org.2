These measurement records are not a result of the scenario described in
the patch description, but as the result of different inodes being
measured.   In the first case, the measurement is most likely coming
from the initramfs, while the second measurement is after pivot root.  
Without digging, I assume the second example is the file hash of an
empty file.

The patch description is much better, but doesn't address the duplicate
measurements without the file changing in between.   Please really
compare the before and after measurement record changes, making sure
you understand the cause for all the duplicate measurement records.  
Based on the results, please update the patch description
appropriately.

thanks,
