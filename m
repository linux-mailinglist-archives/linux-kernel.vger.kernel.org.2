You are right in saying that without lockdown root would own kernel but
this config(EXCLUDE_KERNEL) will independently make sure that kernel
level pmu tracing is not allowed(we return -EACCES) even if LOCKDOWN
config is disabled. So I'm saying that we don't need to depend on
LOCKDOWN config, its good to have LOCKDOWN config enabled but perf
subsystem doesn't have to care about that.

Right, we should then exclude all kernel level pmu tracing, is it fine?

if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_EXCLUDE_KERNEL_HW_ITRACE) && 
!attr.exclude_kernel))
     return -EACCES;

Thanks,
