ok updated in v12 to name it qcom,rpm(h)-stats. similarly driver name 
also updated from qcom_sleep_stats to qcom_stats.

the driver can not be as is enabled for MSM8916. Actually on MSM8916 
(even though its RPM target) it uses fixed offset 0xdba0 from the base 
address in the devicetree.

On all other RPM targets followed by MSM8916 the address for soc sleep 
stats is present at offset 0x14 (RPM_DYNAMIC_ADDR ) from the base 
address but not on MSM8916. so MSM8916 is a special case to enable for 
for RPM stats

To enable this for MSM8916, dynamic_offset need to be false and 
stats_offset need to be given directly as 0xdba0, something similar as 
RPMH targets.

static const struct stats_config rpm_legacy_data = {
         .stats_offset = 0xdba0,
         .num_records = 2,
         .appended_stats_avail = true,
         .dynamic_offset = false,
         .subsystem_stats_in_smem = false,
};

{ .compatible = "qcom,rpm-legacy-stats", .data = &rpm_legacy_data },

and then add

                 sram@290000 {
                         compatible = "qcom,rpm-legacy-stats";
                         reg = <0x00290000 0x10000>;
                 };

which should work fine.

I donot have MSM8916 to validate this but when this driver boots up it 
should create "vlow" and "vmin" files at /sys/kernel/debug/qcom_sleep_stats/
if that is done, it means you are reading stats from correct address 
since the file name is read from the memory itself.

Thanks,
Maulik
