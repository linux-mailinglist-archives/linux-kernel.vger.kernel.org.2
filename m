I supposed.  Didn't feel like a "true" error because nothing has 
actually failed, the chance of the IOMMU fault is low, and I couldn't 
enumerate what would be the expected action for the system user to take 
if they saw this as an error.

I don't have a particularly strong opinion one way or the other.  I 
figured warn was the more conservative option here.

Will change.
