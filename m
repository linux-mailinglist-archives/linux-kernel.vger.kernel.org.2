Sorry, I didn't make it clear here. I mean the amount of code modification
and data analysis. Since we mainly do some process confirmation, if it is
to add trace points, the amount of code is relatively large, if it is to
add log, it is relatively simple. Secondly, the modification of the kernel
and analysis scripts is relatively simple.

We don't use JBD2_DEBUG much in our work. In most cases, we tend to add
hook points and analyze data from hook points. But here because it is a
process confirmation, if the hook point method is adopted, there are more
hook points and the workload is relatively large. Secondly, these hook
points are not needed in the production environment, maybe it is a waste
of time.

In our mixed deployment production environment, we occasionally find that
containers will have priority inversion problems, that is, low-priority
containers will affect the Qos of high-priority containers. We try to do
something to make ext4 work better in the container scene. After a basic
test, we will use the business program to test, because the IO behavior
of the business program is relatively more complicated. It is worth noting
that here we are mainly concerned with the correctness of the process, not
particularly concerned with performance.

:), Perhaps my verification method is not optimal, but I found that jbd2
has a similar framework, and tried to use it, and then found that some
things can be optimized.
