Ouch, I guess I was a bit confused here. I thought the split PMD lock
was part of the struct page for the 4 KB page where the PMD entry is located,
and therefore, with more than one page, it still would make (a little) sense
to use it also for 2 pagetable levels.

However, pmd_to_page() always returns the struct page of the first page,
so there is only one split PMD lock for the whole thing (4 pages for s390).
Of course that means that with 2 pagetable levels, and only one PMD directory,
the split PMD lock would be equivalent to the global pagetable lock, and
therefore not make any sense.

Maybe you could change the description to also mention "more than two"
levels?

I still do not see a real benefit of the patch, e.g. it does not really
fix any possible misconfiguration, at least on s390. But it certainly is not
wrong, and at least it had the benefit of making me aware again of how split
PMD locks work, so I'll happily add this
