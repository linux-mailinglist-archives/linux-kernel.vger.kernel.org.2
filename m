True but many of those can be avoided by opening the file early. At
least seq_file based ones will not allocate later if the output size
doesn't increase. Which should be the case for many. I think it is a
general improvement to push those who allocate during read to an open
time allocation.

What kind of data do you need to examine to make those decisions?

I am definitely curious to learn more.

I am not a great fan of prctl. It has become a dumping ground for all
mix of unrelated functionality. But let's say this is a minor detail at
this stage. So you are proposing to have a per mm mem pool that would be
used as a fallback for an allocation which cannot make a forward
progress, right? Would that pool be preallocated and sitting idle? What
kind of allocations would be allowed to use the pool? What if the pool
is depleted?
