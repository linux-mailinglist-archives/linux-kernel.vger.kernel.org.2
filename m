Okay, I see.

This means that we end up polling for busy in __mmc_poll_for_busy().
However, not by using CMD13 but rather with the ->card_busy() ops (as
mmci has this callback set).

Could it be that the ->card_busy() callback isn't working correctly
for the stm32 variant?

What happens if you temporarily drop the assignment of the
->card_busy() callback, thus force the mmc core to poll with CMD13
instead? Would this work?

Assuming the eMMC card completed the first erase operation
successfully, then yes, the second erase should work.

However, what if the eMMC actually failed with the first erase? How can we know?
