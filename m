When you say "not using a drivers/iommu IOMMU interface" do you
basically mean the device doesn't do DMA?  I can see some benefit to
that, but some drawbacks too.  The *main* form of isolation (or lack
thereof) that groups is about the IOMMU, but groups can also represent
other forms of isolation failure: e.g. a multifunction device, where
function 0 has some debug registers which affect other functions.
That's relevant whether or not any of those functions use DMA.

Now, we could represent those different sorts of isolation separately,
but at the time our thinking was that we should group together devices
that can't be safely isolated for *any* reason, since the practical
upshot is the same: you can't safely split those devices between
different owners.

I don't really see how this is depending on how the device is created.
The current VFIO model is that every device always belongs to a group
- but that group might be a singleton.  That seems less complicated to
me that some devices do and some don't have a group.
