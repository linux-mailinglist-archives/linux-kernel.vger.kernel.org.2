How did I miss that :-(

Actually it's worse than that: the node is removed _after_ the kthread
acknowledges deoffloading and added _before_ the kthread acknowledges
offloading. So a single rcuog loop can well run through a deletion/re-add
pair altogether.

Now since we force another loop with the new add guaranteed visible, the new
loop should handle the missed rdp's that went shortcut by the race.

Let's hope I'm not missing something else... And yes that definetly needs
a fat comment.

Exactly, that part is racy by nature.

You got it right!

Thanks!
