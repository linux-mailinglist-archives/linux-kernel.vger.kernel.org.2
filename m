Hi Ian,

I suggested this before I realized that it would be called from "perf test".

You think that 1m15s could be considered too slow, but I think that it 
could be much slower to now run "perf test" on some other systems. Like 
my arm64 system - see series 
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-perf-users/1631795665-240946-1-git-send-email-john.garry@huawei.com/T/#t 
- where I mention that we have >700 HW PMU events (before applying that 
series to take advantage of the event merging). And each of those events 
would be tested individually - slow...

So firstly maybe a speed or test level flag could be added before we try 
this. Sorry for any inconvenience caused.

Thanks,
John
