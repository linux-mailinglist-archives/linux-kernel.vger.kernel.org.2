Greetings,

Greetings to you and your family.

My name is Mr. Kone Compaore, the auditing general with the bank,
Africa Develop bank (ADB) Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, in West Africa. I
am contacting you to seek your honesty and sincere cooperation in
confidential manner to transfer the sum of 10.5 (Ten million five
hundred thousand Dollars) to your existing or new bank account.

This money belongs to one of our bank client, a Libyan oil exporter
who was working with the former Libyan government; I learn t that he
was killed by the revolutionary forces since October 2011. Our bank is
planning to transfer this entire fund into the government public
treasury as unclaimed fund if nobody comes to claim the money from our
bank after four years without account activities .

What the bank need is proof and information about the late customer
which I will assist you on. This is a genuine, risk free and legal
business transaction, All details shall be sent to you once I hear
from you.

The information as contained herein be accorded the necessary
attention, urgency as well as the secrecy it deserves.

If you are really sure of your integrity, trustworthy and
confidentiality reply back to me urgently for more details

Best regards,
Kone Compaore
