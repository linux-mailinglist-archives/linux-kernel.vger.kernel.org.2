I do not know, I do not use that option, sorry.

If you already have a copy of the kernel git tree, there is never a need
to download the whole thing again.  Just add another remote banch and do
a pull, the difference should be very tiny now compared to what is in
Linus's tree.

Or, to seed the whole thing, download a "git bundle" as described here:
	https://www.kernel.org/best-way-to-do-linux-clones-for-your-ci.html
which you can use to work off of locally, and should be easier to handle
over slow and flaky download connections.

hope this helps,
