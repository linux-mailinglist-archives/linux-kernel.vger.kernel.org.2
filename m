Hi Moritz,

Sorry for the confusion.

We discussed before and I thought we were all aligned.

There are 2 aspects:
1. The purpose I changed COMMAND_RECONFIG_FLAG_PARTIAL to 0 from 1 is to 
align with the current firmware setting. This change will NOT break old 
firmware since always treats request with non-zero value as partial 
reconfiguration.

2. When we add new bitstream authentication function, the old firmware 
couldn't distinguish partial reconfiguration or bitstream authentication 
since the value of both requests were not zero. To address this back 
compatible issue, I extend Intel service layer driver for FPGA manager 
driver to get the running firmware version via SMC call. Then FPGA 
manager driver can decide whether to handle the newly added bitstream 
authentication based on the retrieved firmware version.
