hi,
I really like this new interface

how did you measure that balancing improvement?
is there less kernel cycles spent?

I ran the benchmark and if I'm reading the results correctly I see
performance drop for high cpu numbers (full list attached below).


old perf:                                                                 new perf:

[jolsa@dell-r440-01 perf]$ ./perf.old bench internals synthesize -t       [jolsa@dell-r440-01 perf]$ ./perf bench internals synthesize -t
...
  Number of synthesis threads: 40                                           Number of synthesis threads: 40
    Average synthesis took: 2489.400 usec (+- 49.832 usec)                    Average synthesis took: 4576.500 usec (+- 75.278 usec)
    Average num. events: 956.800 (+- 6.721)                                   Average num. events: 1020.000 (+- 0.000)

maybe profiling will show what's going on?

thanks,
jirka
