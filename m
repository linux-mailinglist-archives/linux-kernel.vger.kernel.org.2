Subject: RMS: If FSF is giving you trouble, recover the (C) using the 30 year
 statutory method and make a new entity.

Dear RMS: This if the FSF is giving you trouble, you could recover your 
copyrights using the 2nd method (the Statutory method), make a new 
foundation, or just a new corp entity, and transfer the copyright again 
to that new entity. A new corp entity costs 200 dollars. You can swing 
that, right? (The legal action vis a vis the copyright recovery takes 
considerably more)

---------------------------------------------------------------
(1st method, for those who have not transferred their copyrights)
(Linux, most OSS projects, those who ignored how RMS set things up and 
thought it was for no reason)

---------------------------------------------------------------
(2nd method, Statutory)
(For those who transferred their copyrights, and are now contending with 
a hostile takeover*)
(*this happens all the time with corps and foundations, you didn't 
expect it to happen to you?)
---------------------------------------------------------------
Additionally if you dislike that method and prefer a different method 
explicitly stated by Congress:
By statutory law, an author can recover any copyrights signed away after 
(+-)30 years (US Copyright act). _

The design of a program etc is a copyrightable aspect. RMS fixed this in 
form 30 years ago.
