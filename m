I think there is indeed value in doing this. Where I'm not sure is regarding
how we allow this to be enabled/configured.

The way I see it, it might be sufficient and simpler to do just something along
those lines:

- Introduce a new struct tracepoint_caller_info, which would contain information
  about file, line number and module name where each trace_*() statement is located.
- Add a new CONFIG_TRACEPOINT_CALLER_INFO which generates this new structure at
  build time for kernel and modules. This would indeed bloat the kernel, but it's
  a build-time configurable trade-off.
- Change the prototype for the tracepoint callbacks to add an additional argument
  "struct tracepoint_caller_info *caller_info". When CONFIG_TRACEPOINT_CALLER_INFO
  is disabled, simply have this pointer be NULL. When CONFIG_TRACEPOINT_CALLER_INFO
  is enabled, pass the tracepoint's caller_info structure as parameter.

It should be straightforward to adapt the tracepoint callback prototypes within each
user within the Linux kernel tree. And for out-of-tree users, they have to adapt to
that kind of change already anyway.

Thoughts ?

Thanks,

Mathieu
