Hi,

For this change, I also tried removing the setting of PERF_SAMPLE_TIME in cs_etm__synth_events(). In theory, this would remove the sorting when opening the file, but the change doesn't affect when the built-in events are saved to the inject file. Resulting in events like MMAP and COMM with timestamps, but the synthesised events without. This results in the same issue of the synthesised events appearing before the COMM and MMAP events. If it was possible to somehow tell perf to remove timestamps from built-in events, removing PERF_SAMPLE_TIME would probably be the right solution, because we don't set sample.time.

For Arm v8.4 we will have the kernel time in the etm timestamps, so an if can be added to switch between this behaviour and the next (more correct) one depending on the hardware. 

On the subject of timestamps, but not related to this change, some combinations of timestamp options aren't working. For example:

    perf record -e cs_etm/time,@tmc_etr0/u --per-thread
or  perf record -e cs_etm/@tmc_etr0/u --timestamp --per-thread

These don't work because of the assumption that etm->timeless_decoding == --per-thread
and kernel timestamps enabled (/time/ or --timestamp) == etm timestamps enabled (/timestamp/), which isn't necessarily true.

This can be made to work with a few code changes for cs_etm/time,timestamp/u --per-thread, but cs_etm/time/u --per-thread could be a bit more work. Changes involved would be using "per_cpu_mmaps" in some places instead of etm->timeless_decoding, and also setting etm->timeless_decoding based on whether there are any etm timestamps, not kernel ones. Although to search for any etm timestamp would involve a full decode ahead of time which might not be feasible (or maybe just checking the options, although that's not how it's done in cs_etm__is_timeless_decoding() currently).

Or, we could force /time/ and /timestamp/ options to always be enabled together in the record stage. 


Thanks
James
