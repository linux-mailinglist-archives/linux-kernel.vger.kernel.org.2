The patch you linked doesn't have a noncanonical attribute, though.
So I'm not sure how to reliably call into asm from C.

(The more I think about it, the less I like "canonical".  What is
"canonical"?  The symbol?  The function body?  Something else?)

Yes.

I admit that, in the trivial case where the asm code is *not* a
C-ABI-compliant function, giving a type that doesn't fool the compiler
into thinking that it might be is probably the best fix.  Maybe we
should standardize something, e.g.:

struct raw_symbol;  /* not defined anywhere */
#define DECLARE_RAW_SYMBOL(x) struct raw_symbol x[]

and then we write this:

DECLARE_RAW_SYMBOL(entry_SYSCALL_64);

wrmsrl(..., (unsigned long)entry_SYSCALL_64);

It would be a bit nifty if we didn't need a forward declaration, but
I'm not immediately seeing a way to do this without hacks that we'll
probably regret;

But this doesn't help the case in which the symbol is an actual
C-callable function and we want to be able to call it, too.
