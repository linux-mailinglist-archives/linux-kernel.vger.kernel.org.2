Perhaps more of a philosophical question for you and Alex. There is no
doubt that the direction you guided for /dev/ioasid is a much cleaner one,
especially after VDPA emerged as another IOMMU backed framework.

The question is what do we do with the nested translation features that have
been targeting the existing VFIO-IOMMU for the last three years? That
predates VDPA. Shall we put a stop marker *after* nested support and say no
more extensions for VFIO-IOMMU, new features must be built on this new
interface?

If we were to close a checkout line for some unforeseen reasons, should we
honor the customers already in line for a long time?

This is not a tactic or excuse for not working on the new /dev/ioasid
interface. In fact, I believe we can benefit from the lessons learned while
completing the existing. This will give confidence to the new
interface. Thoughts?
