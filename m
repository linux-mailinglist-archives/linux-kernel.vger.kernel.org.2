Thank you all for your comments.  I see that everyone agrees that the
error print is useful for SMB2, so I will drop this patch.

Thank you for the suggestions.  In my case, I've only received some
reports of this error being emitted very rarely (couple of times a month
in our stability tests).  Right now it looks like the problem may only
be with a particular NAS, and we're looking into triggering oplock
breaks more often and catching the problem with some more logging.
