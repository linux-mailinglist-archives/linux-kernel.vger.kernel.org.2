Have heard that the JRE makes assumptions on the number of threads to 
use based on memory.

Lots of Humans use top and vmstat to try to figure out what is available 
in their environment.Â  Debugging tools trying to figure out why an 
application is running poorly.

We would like to not need to mount the cgroup file system into a 
container at all, and as Eric stated processes trying to differentiate 
between cgroupv1 and cgroupv2.
