For this patch I wanted to test the decoding of SPE events, given fixed
inputs, in order to lock the current implementation of the decoder.

I think adding additional smoke testing is a good idea. We could also
check if CONTEXTIDR is enabled in the config (either /boot/config... or
/proc/config.gz).
