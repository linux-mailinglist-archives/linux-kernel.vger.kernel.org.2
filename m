Attn: Beneficiary,

  I am Mrs Robin Sanders, Former U.S.A Ambassador to Nigeria. With
reference to your entitlement fund and inline with the CHANGE OF
BENEFICIARY'S APPLICATION, signed by Mrs. Glenda F. Ward with your
purported authorization. This issue has been carefully examined and we
have declined Mrs. Ward's application as the application lacks regular
signature. But Did you ever instruct Mrs Glenda F. Ward to claim your
fund worth US$7.000.000? Below is the bank account information
provided by Mrs Glenda F. Ward saying that you authorized her to claim
your fund that you are terminally ill.

Bank's name----- Meta Bank
Bank's address----KS 67217 5501 S. Broadband Ln. Souix Falls, SD
Account Name----Mrs Glenda F. Ward
Account No----70008820737078
Routing Number-- 073972181

If you had not authorized the change of your bank account in respect
to your outstanding entitlement Payment, therefore notify me
immediately as the notification / declaration was supported with a
sworn affidavit from Lagos high court ref: ilk /jj/202/k2021, dated
28th May 2021 and signed by Mrs. Glenda Ward who claim and stated
in the sworn declaration that you authorized her to claim the said
fund on your behalf to a different bank account in the U.S.A as stated
above because you were terminally ill and the Doctor who is incharge
of your case stated that you will not stay more than one Month before
passing away.

This development has caused lots of discrepancies in your payment file
that is why we had to suspend your payment and prompted to contact you
directly before re-validating your payment. You can be rest assured
that I will do everything within my capacity to successfully actualize
the quick transfer of your fund to any of your nominated bank account.

Kindly get back to me as soon as possible so that I will direct you on
what to do.

Sincerely Yours
Mrs Robin Sanders
Fmr. U.S Ambassador
