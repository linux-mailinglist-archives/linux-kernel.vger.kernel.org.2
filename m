So i_lock is supposed to protect i_opflags for writing AFAICT. For reading
we don't seem to bother in some cases and I agree that is potentially
problematic. It is *mostly* OK because we initialize i_opflags when loading
inode into memory / adding it to dcache. But sometimes we also update them
while the inode is alive. Now this is fine for the particular flag we
update but in theory, if the compiler wants to screw us and stores
temporarily some nonsensical value in i_opflags we'd have a problem. This
is mostly a theoretical issue but eventually we probably want to fix this.
