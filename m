Ok. I guess we have to wait for an answer from NXP. But it strikes as
odd that it there is no Secure World, you'll loose one job ring.

Mh, I had a closer look at the IMX8M SRM (I don't have one for the
IMX8MM yet). It looks like secure world can reassign the Job Ring
to non-secure world though (unless LDID is set). If that is the
case I think, deciding at probe time if a job ring is available is
not correct; as it can be reassigned later.

So maybe u-boot (or TF-A) should mark that node as disabled after
all.

If the BootROM is actually already assigning this to secure world
(and setting the lock bit LDID). Then it can also be removed from
the linux dtsi, because there is no way it can be assigned to linux
anyways.

Will try to follow you here later.

I don't think you have to take the PRIM_TZ bit into account. PRIM_TZ=1
implies OWN_TZ=1. (I'm not sure what PRIM_TZ=0 and OWN_TZ=1 is good
for though). But as mentioned above, I'm not convinced that deciding
at probe time is the solution here.

yep.

Thanks, I also read the SRM for this bit, right now.
