{sigh}

What happens if the driver core is just about to call hot_add_show() and
the module is removed from the system.  It then calls to the memory
location that hot_add_show() was previously at, but now that is not a
valid pointer to code, and boom.

That all happened _BEFORE_ you were even able to call try_module_get().

You have to check if a function pointer is valid _BEFORE_ you call into
it.

So you might have reduced the race, but it is still there.  Odds are you
can reproduce it if you enable "overwrite module memory with 0xff when
removed" debug options.
