Yes, an example is a process creates the fd and registers some events.
Then the process forks and the child registers another event using the
same fd that was inherited.

If the original process writes while the child process registers at that
point the FD array can get resized / moved, therefore we need RCU deref
protection when resizing, etc.

I have a few gauntlet tools that try to crash user_events by writing,
registering, unregistering at weird times to try to flush this stuff
out.

Agree 100%, I've gone back and forth on which is better for a while. I'm
happy to update to RCU and send out a V3. Want to make sure we have
consensus of the right approach before spinning on it :)
