My Beloved One,

Greetings in the name of the LORD Almighty, the giver of every good
thing.  I know that this proposal will definitely come to you as a
huge surprise, but I implore you to take your time to go through it
carefully as the decision you make will go a long way to determine my
future.

I am Mrs.Annik Brown, based in Ivory Coast. an ageing widow of 65
years old, suffering from long time illness and Cancer of the Breast.
I have some funds which I inherited from my late husband, the sum of
USD $5, 4 Million Dollars and I needed a very honest and God fearing
person who can withdraw this money then use the funds for Charity
works.

I WISH TO ENTRUST THIS FUND TO YOU FOR CHARITY WORKS.  I found your
email address from the internet  Search after honest prayers to the
LORD to bring me an Honest person whom I can confide and  entrusted
this money for Humanitarian, and  I decided to contact you if you may
be willing and interested to handle these trusted  funds in good
faith.

My Doctor told me yesterday that I will undergo a surgical Operation
soonest due to the sickness has gotten to a dangerous stage. Having
known my condition I decided to donate this fund for Charity. I am
desperately in need of assistance in this very Humanitarian assistance
and I have summoned up courage to contact you for this task, you must
not fail me.

This is not stolen money and there are no dangers involved in the
Transaction. Please if you would be able to use the funds for the
Charity works please kindly let me know immediately for further
details.

Waiting for your response.
Please always pray for me.
Remain blessed.
Mrs.Annik Brown.
