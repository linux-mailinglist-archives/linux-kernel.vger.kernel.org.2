No, for sleepable context, pcm_mutex is *always* taken when
adding/deleting a BE, and that's the main protection for the link.
The BE stream lock is taken additionally over it at adding/deleting a
BE, just for the code path via FE and BE trigger.

dpcm_lock was put in the places that could be recursively taken.
So this caused some deadlock, I suppose.

No, show_state() itself doesn't take any lock, but its caller
dpcm_state_read_file() takes the pcm_mutex.  That protects the list
addition / deletion.

The pcm_mutex is needed for every sleepable function that treat DPCM
FE link, but the mutex is taken only at the upper level, i.e. the
top-most caller like PCM ops FE itself or the DAPM calls.

That said, pcm_mutex is the top-most protection of BE links in FE.
But, there is a code path where a mutex can't be used, and that's the
FE and BE trigger.  For protecting against this, the FE stream lock is
taken only at the placing both adding and deleting a BE *in addition*.
At those places, both pcm_mutex and FE stream lock are taken.

BE stream lock is taken in addition below the above mutex and FE
locks.
