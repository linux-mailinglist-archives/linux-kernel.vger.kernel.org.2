Subject: [PATCH 1/2] soc: qcom: rpmhpd: Rename rpmhpd struct names
Date:   Tue, 16 Nov 2021 10:56:21 +0530
Message-Id: <1637040382-22987-1-git-send-email-rnayak@codeaurora.org>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.7.4
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The rpmhpd structs were named with a SoC-name prefix, but then
they got reused across multiple SoC families making things confusing.
Rename all the struct names to remove SoC-name prefixes.
No other functional change as part of this patch.
