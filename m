I don't think this question is stupid, since I asked it myself :)
You can find this discussion here:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/10/21/900

Let me quote it here too
:> 1) VM_FAULT_OOM may be triggered w/o execution of out_of_memory()
:> for exampel it can be caused by incorrect vm fault operations, 
:> (a) which can return this error without calling allocator at all.
:
:I would argue this to be a bug. How can that particular code tell
:whether the system is OOM and the oom killer is the a reasonable measure
:to take?
:
:> (b) or which can provide incorrect gfp flags and allocator can fail without execution of out_of_memory.
:
: I am not sure I can see any sensible scenario where pagefault oom killer
: would be an appropriate fix for that.
:
:> (c) This may happen on stable/LTS kernels when successful allocation was failed by hit into limit of legacy memcg-kmem contoller.
:> We'll drop it in upstream kernels, however how to handle it in old kenrels?
:
:Triggering the global oom killer for legacy kmem charge failure is
:clearly wrong. Removing oom killer from #PF would fix that problem.

I would note: (c) is not theoretical but real life problem, in this case allocation was failed without execution of OOM,
however, it is in this case that execution out_of_memory() from pagefault_out_of_memory() leads to a disaster.
