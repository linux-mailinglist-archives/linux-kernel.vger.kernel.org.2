All of these links will break in a few days.

And a line number is not "1540ff" :(

You can just reference a file in the kernel source tree directly, no
need to go back to kernel.org

Can you please wrap your changelog text at 72 columns like git asked you
to when you committed the change to your local tree?

I do not understand, why is this code in the changelog?

What commit does this fix?  Should it have a "Fixes:" tag in it?

And should it go to stable kernel(s)?

Also, this is a v2 patch, please include below the --- line what changed
from the previous version when you resend v3.

thanks,
