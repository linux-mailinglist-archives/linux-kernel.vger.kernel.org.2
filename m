Yes they could, perhaps we could change our command line arguments to remove
recording of timestamps completely. But I think that the auto enabling of
timestamps for per-cpu mode is only additive so there is no way to disable
it on the command line.

Perhaps we could make a change there instead to make the event configuration more flexible.

There is a similar concept with the --timestamp argument where it has both
"not set" and "set, but set to false" variables to distinguish between when the user hasn't
provided anything and when they've provided the negative:

	OPT_BOOLEAN_SET('T', "timestamp", &record.opts.sample_time,
			&record.opts.sample_time_set,

opts.sample_time is whether timestamps are on or not and
opts.sample_time_set is whether the user provided any argument, true or false.

Thanks
James
