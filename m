Sure, unfortunately it is blanked in the simplified spec so I (think I) cannot simply cite it now.
If access to the full spec is a problem for many contributors of the list, I would reconsider the legal aspects.
The part I'm referring to is the last (two) sentence(s) of the section "Single Block Write" in 4.12.3 Data Write.
(Single Block Write is the correct section as all R1 (no b) commands with data behave like Single Block Write.
This info itself is scattered throughout the (simplified) spec, but for CMD42 it is:
"The card lock/unlock command has the structure and bus transaction type of a regular single block write command."
For some other commands it is in the command description column of the 4.7.4)

I wouldn't say broken, it seems to do what is described.
But right now busy polling is essentially CMD13 polling, right? at least for card_busy_detect.
So it doesn't hurt polling for TRAN.

But not for all commands busy signalling <=> PROG state is true:
"The card may provide buffering for block write. This means that the next block can be sent to the card while the previous is being programmed." (4.3)
"There is no buffering option for write CSD, write protection and erase. This means that while the card is busy servicing any one of these commands, no other data transfer commands will be accepted. DAT0 line will be kept low as long as the card is busy and in the Programming State." (4.3)
Definitely leaves us with MMC_PROGRAM_CID, CMD20, CMD42, MMC_SET_TIME, MMC_GEN_CMD and both SD_WRITE_EXTR.
Furthermore I think the cleaner solution is to poll for TRAN anyway. Just in theory there does not seem to be a timing constraint for when the card starts signalling busy for R1 (non-b) commands.
Just in theory the ioctl handling could be done BEFORE the card ever moves to PROG and starts signalling busy. (Im not sure about this though)

Fair. I will happily remove any multi block write commands.
Just seemed like the safer way to do so, but I have not specifically checked if any cards violate this here.

Okay.

Might make sense to let userspace issue read/write, too.
But I understand if this is not desired.

Why not? Sure they move to rcv first, but if data stops they move to PROG.

No, seems unlikely to hit this, as PROG will likely be shorter than getting a second command through.

Again I don't know why you would not need to poll.
The force erase has a good reason to remain in PROG for long, but whatever, a card may decide to just take 5 seconds in unlock PROG. (to prevent bruteforcing passwords lets say)(Not anything I have seen or expect to see)

GEN_CMD is extremly interesting for issuing vendor commands from user-space.
Not sure if anyone uses it (yet), but if so it's unlikely to be seen in the wild.
SD_WRITE_EXTR_MULTI is simply too new to really say.
MMC_SET_TIME probably not used.

See above.

Well in theory you're then dropping the buffered writing feature of the SD spec if waiting for TRAN, too.
I'm fine with that, especially since it is not desired to be used through ioctl anyway?
