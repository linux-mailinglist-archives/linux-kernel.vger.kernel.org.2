Thanks for splitting your series, I think it's much easier to review
and contains much less imprecise changes.

I have a few minor comments (see the following e-mails), please address
them and then please send all your patches a single series, not like 6+
independent patches.

I'll then require someone to test it if we are good I'll merge it.

Thanks,
Miqu√®l
