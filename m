No you are right and indeed I saw that anomaly, but I have not addressed
it since, even if wrong, it is harmless and transfer_id is really used
only for debugging/profiling, while the missing reinit_completion is
potentially broken.

So the current real 'looping do_xfer' behavior is safe and so this missing
reinit is only potentially broken in the future, and we cannot really
know now in advance about some future protocol needs, but it seems as of now
wrong that you'll want to keep going on and reuse an xfer for the same command
after an error in your loop.

On the other side we allow such behaviour, so I thought was good to
provide a safe net if it is misused.

But, beside this patches, that, as said, are more defensive that strictly
needed as of now, I think now it's worth mentioning that this same 'issue'
affects also, as an example, the new mechanism I introduced later in this
same series to always use monotonically increasing sequence number for
outgoing messages.

In that case I stick to the current behavior and I assign such monotonically
increasing sequence numbers to message during xfer_get, but the potential
issue is the same: if a do_xfer loop is used you end up reusing the same
seq_num for multiple do_xfers (so defeating really the mechanism itself
that aims not to reuse immediately the most recently used seq_num).

In that case I did this to keep it simple and to avoid placing more burden
on tx path by picking and assigning a seq_num upon each transfer...but, again,
also this behavior of picking a seq_num only at xfer_get is NOT really broken
as of now even for do_xfer loops since we bail out on error and you won't
really reuse that xfer.

It's just that in this seq_num selection case seems to add a lot of burden
and complexity if moved to the do_xfer phase, while status/reinit seemed
to me cheaper to move it in the do_xfer so I tried to play defensive.

At the end, in general I would say that all of these ops (status/reinit/
seq_nums/transfer_id) DO really belong logically to the do_xfer phase more than
to the xfer_get/xfer_get_init, but in reality we can cope with having them
@xfer_get/get_init and this keeps things simple and reduce burden, especially
in the monotonic seq_nums case: so I am not so sure anymore if it is fine to
move reinit/status to the do_xfer, as proposed here, while keeping seq_nums
(for good reasons) to the xfer_get phase, because we'd use 2 different strategies
to address similar issues.

I would say: just keep reinit and status in the xfer_get phase instead and
maybe warn somehow if a failed xfer is detected being reused. (but this
would anyway need a check in every tx transaction to see if status != SUCCESS
so is it worth ?)

Lot of overthinking for a one-liner :D ... sorry

Thanks,
Cristian
