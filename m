Removing the host, also means removing the card. Although, as I said,
I need some more time to think of the best solution.

Here's a report, triggered with some manual hacks and by using the
mmc-utils usesland tool.

You may very well be correct in you reasoning above, but I just need
to convince myself about it.

It's likely, but allow me some more time to think about it. To make
sure we do the right thing.
