A customer did run into it through a series of automated tests. I was
able to finally reproduce with the instructions given below. I
simplified it given that the series of test the customer was running
was much more complex.

Whoever said that it was? This is just a way to reproduce an issue which
was reported.

The goal here is to prevent an rmmod call if this succeeds. If it
succeeds then any subsequent rmmod will fail. Can you explain how
this is still racy?
