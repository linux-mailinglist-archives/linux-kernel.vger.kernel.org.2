Well, for that approach I assume we could do something like special-case 
0, or if it's a mutable per-domain value maybe just initialise it to 
SIZE_MAX or whatever such that it would never be reached in practice. 
Whichever way, it was meant to be implied that anything at the domain 
level would still be subject to final adjustment by the init_context hook.
