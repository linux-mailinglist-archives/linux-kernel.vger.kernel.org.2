Ok, but having this all in one big list of attributes does work.  You
can have multiple attribute groups listed together (that's why it's a
list of attribute groups, not just one attribute group that the driver
core is expecting.)

You just put the logic of "is this group needed or not?" in the
is_visible() callback for that group.  You then don't need the
function_init() blocks to do anything with sysfs except maybe set a
device variable of "I have type foo" for the is_visible() callback to
check.

Yes, it's not obvious, but should clean up a lot of code in the end.
