Yes if you inject on a file with no timestamps and then open it, then the function queue_event()
in ordered_events.c is not hit.

If you create a file based on one with timestamps, then the queue_event() function is hit
even on the injected file.

The relevant bit of code is here:

	if (tool->ordered_events) {
		u64 timestamp = -1ULL;

		ret = evlist__parse_sample_timestamp(evlist, event, &timestamp);
		if (ret && ret != -1)
			return ret;

		ret = perf_session__queue_event(session, event, timestamp, file_offset);
		if (ret != -ETIME)
			return ret;
	}

	return perf_session__deliver_event(session, event, tool, file_offset);

If tool->ordered_events is set AND the timestamp for the sample parses to be non zero
and non -1:

	if (!timestamp || timestamp == ~0ULL)
		return -ETIME;

Then the event is added into the queue, otherwise it goes straight through to perf_session__deliver_event()
The ordering can be disabled manually with tool->ordered_events and --disable-order and is also disabled
with --dump-raw-trace.

It seems like processing the file only really works when all events are unordered but in the right order,
or ordered with the right timestamps set.

Yes it seems like synthesised samples are assigned sensible timestamps.

	perf record -e intel_pt//u top
	perf inject -i perf.data -o perf-intel-per-cpu.inject.data --itrace=i100i --strip
	perf report -i perf-intel-per-cpu.inject.data -D

Results in the correct binary and DSO names and the SAMPLE timestamp is after the COMM:

	0 381165621595220 0x1200 [0x38]: PERF_RECORD_COMM exec: top:20173/20173
	
	...
	
	2 381165622169297 0x13b0 [0x38]: PERF_RECORD_SAMPLE(IP, 0x2): 20173/20173: 0x7fdaa14abf53 period: 100 addr: 0
 	... thread: top:20173
 	...... dso: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-2.27.so

Per-thread also works, but no samples or events have timestamps.
