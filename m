Yes, in both cases the load instructions emitted for the READ_ONCE()
macros must be emitted in order.  The underlying hardware is free
to reorder.

Or an additional READ_ONCE() for b or a WRITE_ONCE() for d.  But again,
this would constrain only the compiler, not the hardware.

But this wouldn't matter in most cases, because both b and d are local
variables whose addresses were never taken.  So someone would need to
be using something crazy to poke into others' stacks for this to matter.

It looks like you have most of it.

That sounds like a very good approach!

Keep in mind that I am worried not just about the current state of
the code and compilers, but also their possible future states.
