I'm not sure if I am following your thinking here. The HW, of course,
verifies authentication of the image and acts according to the image
type. I don't think it is reasonable to require the class driver to
interpret the data to determine what it is. That implies that the
class driver would have to know the header format and possible values.
It also means that changes to the header format would require patches
to the class driver.

The FPGA card is trusted by virtue of the fact that the customer
purchased it and physically placed it in the machine. If the FPGA card
(or the lower level driver) validates the image, then why does the
Class driver need to be concerned about the file type? I think the
purpose of the class driver is primarily to provide a common API and
perform common functions so that they don't have to be replicated
among similar low-level drivers. It is up to the low-level driver
or the device itself to ensure that the data received is acceptable.

If the card receives data through the fpga-mgr upload facility that
isn't strictly a firmware update, and if the lower-level driver or
the card handles it and returns appropriate status - is that really
a problem?

By host driver, do you mean the class driver? Or the lower-level device
driver?

It seems to me that you are saying that self-describing images are not
acceptable? Or at least they are not acceptable payload for an FPGA
Manager firmware-update API?

The FPGA Image Load Framework was designed with the concept of
transferring data to a device without imposing a purpose on the data.
The expectation is that the lower-level driver or the device will
validate the data. Is there something fundamentally wrong with that
approach? And if not, why couldn't we incorporate a similar image_load
API into the FPGA Manager?
