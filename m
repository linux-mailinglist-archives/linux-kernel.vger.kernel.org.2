I see, thanks for working on that.

Yes, this is what I think it will be the best approach. I believe the
code will be less complex, it's more future proof (it's ready for y2038)
and when glibc supports time64, we can make this code even simpler using
`-D__USE_TIME_BITS64` to compile it. Thanks again for working on that!
