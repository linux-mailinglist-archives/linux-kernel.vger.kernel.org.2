This is a horrible api.  Now one has to go and look up why "0" was added
to a function as a parameter.

If you don't want to allocate the buffer, then make a function of that
name and call that.  As you only have one "flag", don't try to make
something generic here that is obviously not generic at all.

You all can do better than this.
