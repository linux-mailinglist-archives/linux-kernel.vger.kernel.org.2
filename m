Ah right, I do remember discussing that situation, but I think I 
misinterpreted dart_domain->dart representing "the DART instance" here 
to mean we weren't trying to accommodate that just yet.

Hmm, yes, as above I was overlooking that, although there are still 
various ideas that come to mind; the question becomes whether they're 
actually worthwhile or just too-clever-for-their-own-good hacks. The 
exact format of fwspec->ids is not fixed (other than the ACPI IORT code 
having a common understanding with the Arm SMMU drivers) so in principle 
you could munge some sort of DART instance index or indeed anything, but 
if it remains cleaner to manage your own data internally then by all 
means keep doing that.

Sure, I guessed that much from "identity map" - it was more a question 
of why that means 0x03020100... rather than, say, 0x0c0d0e0f... or 
0x76543210..., and perhaps the reason for "restoring" it in the first place.

Urgh, *now* I think I get it - the addressing limitation WRT the 
physical memory map layout had also slipped my mind. So you describe the 
RC *as if* it had a physical bus offset, rely on iommu-dma ignoring it 
when active (which is more by luck than design - we don't expect to ever 
see a device with a real hard-wired offset upstream of an IOMMU, 
although I did initially try to support it back in the very early days), 
and otherwise statically program a translation such that anyone else who 
*does* respect bus_dma_regions finds things work as expected.

That actually seems like an even stronger argument for having the 
fake-bypass table belong to the DART rather than the domain, and at that 
point you shouldn't even need the mismatch restriction, since as long as 
you haven't described the fake offset for any devices who *can* achieve 
real bypass, then "attach to an identity domain" simply comes down to 
doing the appropriate thing for each individual stream, regardless of 
whether it's the same nominal identity domain that another device is 
using or a distinct one (it's highly unlikely that two groups would ever 
get attached to one identity domain rather than simply having their own 
anyway, but it is technically possible).

It's certainly... "creative", and TBH I don't hate it (in a "play the 
hand you've been given" kind of way), but the one significant downside 
is that if the DART driver isn't loaded for any reason, PCI DMA will 
look like it should be usable but then just silently (or not so 
silently) fail.

FWIW if you do want to keep the option open, I'd be inclined to have the 
DT just give an "honest" description of just the 32-bit limitation, then 
have the DART driver's .probe_device sneakily modify the bus_dma_region 
to match the relevant fake-bypass table as appropriate. It's possible 
other folks might hate that even more though :D

Actually I missed that we're already under dart_domain->lock at this 
point anyway, so it's not going to make much difference, but it does 
mean that the spin_lock_irqsave() above could just be spin_lock(), 
unless it's possible to relax the domain locking a bit such that we 
don't have to do the whole domain init with IRQs masked.

Splitting IOMMU_DOMAIN_DMA into two to replace iommu_dma_strict being an 
orthogonal thing.

As before, if you can fit in some kind of DART instance identifier which 
isn't impractical to unpack than it makes sense to use the fwspec since 
it's already there. However if you still need to allocate something 
per-device rather than just stashing an existing pointer in iommu_priv, 
then you may as well keep everything together there. If the worst known 
case could still fit in just two DART pointers and two 64-bit bitmaps, 
I'd be inclined to just have that as a fixed structure and save all the 
extra bother - you're not cross-architecture like the fwspec code, and 
arm64's minimum kmalloc granularity has just gone back up to 128 bytes 
(but even at 64 bytes you'd have had plenty of room).

Actually by this point it was late and I wasn't thinking as clearly as I 
could have been, apologies ;)

I believe a module unload is in fact the *only* time you should expect 
to see .remove called - you want to set .suppress_bind_attrs in your 
driver data because there's basically no way to prevent manual unbinding 
from blowing up - so it should be fine to unconditionally clear the ops 
at this point (being removed means you must have successfully probed, so 
any ops must be yours).

Cheers,
Robin.
