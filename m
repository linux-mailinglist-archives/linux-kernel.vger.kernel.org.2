The interface exists. sched_setscheduler(2)

The truth is that real-time systems need to be carefully designed and
parametrized. And that's only possible when _all_ of the system
components and their constraints are known. Trying to solve it at the
device driver level of a single device is impossible and a guarantee for
fail.

If the customer does not know how to do it, then I really have to ask
why he's trying to use a real-time system at all. There is no real-time
system which magically tunes itself by pulling the overall system
constraints out of thin air.

There is a very simple reason: The driver writer cannot know about the
requirements of the complete system which is composed of kernel, drivers
and user space applications, unless the driver writer is fully aware of
the overall system design and constraints.

How is that supposed to work on a general purpose kernel which is
utilized for a gazillion of different use cases which all have different
expectations?

It simply cannot work because default A will only work for usecase A and
be completely wrong for all others.

There is no such thing as the expected priority of an interrupt thread
which can be applied upfront.

There are ~5400 instances of request*irq() in the kernel source and
there is no way to make priority decisions for them which work for every
RT system out there.

The kernel sets a default and the system designer, admin, user has to
take care of tuning it to match the expectations and constraints of his
particular application scenario.

The kernel provides an userspace interface to do that. That interface
might be a bit awkward to use, but there are tools out there which help
with that, and if at all we can think about providing a better and
easier to use interface for this.

Trying to solve that at the kernel level is putting the cart before the
horse.
