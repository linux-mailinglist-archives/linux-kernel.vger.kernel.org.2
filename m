Ah, thanks for investigating.

I think it's fine to require op->start to return NULL, even if it didn't
cause this infinite loop.

Doh, right.

Hm the debugfs files alloc_tracess/free_traces for any cache with non-zero
objects (see /proc/slabinfo for that) should have t->count > 0. If the files
are created for a cache, it means the related SLAB_STORE_USER debugging was
enabled both during config and boot-time. If you see only a few caches with
alloc_tracess/free_traces (because they are from e.g. some test module that
adds SLAB_STORE_USER explicitly) and all happen to have 0 objects, boot with
slub_debug=U parameter and then all caches will have this enabled and many
will have >0 objects.
