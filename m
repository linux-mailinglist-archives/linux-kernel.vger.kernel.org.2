Actually I think read-only sysctl attributes would be a better idea.

The rationale for this is that we have two misc devices sgx_enclave and
sgx_provision, and these are global attributes even applicable to KVM.

It does not matter functionality-wise, but API-wise it'd look stupid to
directly associate to sgx_enclave.

I.e. I'd add something along the lines of 

static struct ctl_path x86_sysctl_path[] = {
        { .procname = "kernel", },
	{ .procname = "x86", },
	{ }
};

static struct ctl_table x86_sysctl_table[] = {
	{
		.procname       = "sgx_nr_all_pages",
		.mode           = 0444,
                /* rest ... */
	},
	{
		.procname       = "sgx_nr_free_pages",
		.mode           = 0444,
                /* rest ... */
	},
	{ }
};

And write Documentation/x86/proc.rst.
