I got some mails on some old posts here, please update: Fair Pay 
discussion is over, and concluded with LCPU.

My media chan is here: 
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3BcyFY1Bphc7smGH-IGLVw Bit Qabbi, 
which always has been about the monotheistic angle, now also with the 
term Qabbi, taking inspiration from the muslim shaped Qaba, for design.

Knowing the muslim debate follows, we have made a joke reply to this, 
seeing that it is mostly based in a deviant Eid, which I am not 
interested in. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDDmHQv0dTHPjdwJwKrjLqQ

A discussion on reality goes to the standard expression of Alla, and 
this should then be the goal, and is already on my projects.

Trance actually was this in the 90s, but when it reached that stage, 
many became confused, and it mostly failed. (While it did actually 
represent reality in media a few times). I was ready for this and DID
become a muslim.

LCPU representing natural progression in computing space.

Serenity,
