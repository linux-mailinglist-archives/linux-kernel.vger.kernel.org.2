I don't think that's possible.  Same-CPU races between interrupt and
process context are simpler because the CPU always observes its own writes
in order and the interrupt handler completes "between" two instructions.

eg a load-store CPU will do:

load 0 from address A
or 8 with result
store 8 to A

Two CPUs can do:

CPU 0			CPU 1
load 0 from A
			load 0 from A
or 8 with 0
			or 4 with 0
store 8 to A
			store 4 to A

and the store of 8 is lost.

process			interrupt
load 0 from A
			load 0 from A
			or 4 with 0
			store 4 to A
or 8 with 0
store 8 to A

so the store of 4 would be lost.

but we expect the interrupt handler to restore it.  so we actually have this:

load 0 from A
			load 0 from A
			or 4 with 0
			store 4 to A
			load 4 from A
			clear 4 from 4
			store 0 to A
or 8 with 0
store 8 to A


If we have a leak where someone forgets to restore the nofs, that might
cause this.  We could check for the allocation mask bits being clear at
syscall exit (scheduling with these flags set is obviously ok).
