Thx for your feedback.

Good idea. Used this phrase somewhere else also, addressed it there in a
septate patch in the series I just sent:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-doc/cover.1616181657.git.linux@leemhuis.info/

That's why it explained in the reference section. That is a bit hard to
spot just from the patch.

No, this is just repeating the text from the step-by-step guide, as it's
done everywhere in the reference section. It's hard to see in the diff
and more clear when you look at the document as a whole.

The latest series addresses this:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-doc/cover.1616181657.git.linux@leemhuis.info/

To avoid repeated text I had to use this in the end:
``` Perform the first three steps in the section "Reporting issues only
occurring in older kernel version lines" above. ```

Not ideal, but not too bad and works.

Thx again for your suggestions!

Ciao, Thorsten
