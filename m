But what do you want to see?

We have a single piece of hardware that needs a specific power sequence,
which is interacted with using both UART and PCIe.

Do you mean "device" as in the IC or device as in struct device? Because
we do have one physical IC, that has a need for a specific power on
sequence, but we have two struct device, on two different busses in
Linux interacting with this thing.

Okay, so DT tells us that there's actually a WiFi thing on the PCIe bus,
even though we can't find it, so we probe something...then what?
