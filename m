Can you describe the sequence that you used to start them? That may be
useful to understand the criteria you used?

If you want to visualize the topology we're using in our 'nocodec'
tests, see

https://sof-ci.01.org/linuxpr/PR3177/build6440/devicetest/?model=ADLP_RVP_NOCODEC&testcase=verify-kernel-boot-log

and use the sof-adl-nocodec.

it's a bog-standard topology with processing entities connected by buffers.

I don't fully understand the notion of mixer input DAI, in our case we
have a bunch of PCM devices connected to a mixer. The mixer is not
directly connected to a DAI.

I share Peter's analysis, there cannot be any restrictions on
connections - at any time. A mixer input might become active and be
added to the mix. We might have a temporary lock to delay new
connections but cannot not reject them outright based on BE state.

That's a different question - and a good one.

In the case of a mixer, the propagation of hw_params is a broken
concept. It leads to the first FE configuring the BE to define its
preferred parameters, e.g. S16_LE format. If later on a second FE is
started which could play S24_LE, the mixer and BE are already configured
to a lower resolution. A mixer should really have its own parameters and
be the start of a new 'domain' - as Lars described it several years ago
at the audio miniconference.

For now, the only restriction that we could enforce is that the BE
cannot be reconfigured after the prepare step.

Note that our DAIs tolerate multiple calls to hw_params. If you have a
case where the hw_params allocates resources, maybe you should consider
moving that allocation to the prepare step, or free them if you detect a
reconfiguration. That would be something needed even outside of the DPCM
scope. Similarly you need to support the case where the DAI hw_free is
called without hw_params ever being called, it's a known sequence that
can happen if the FE hw-params fails.

we haven't used more than 2 users, but it's already broken at 2 with
race conditions left and right. I am really surprised you managed to
have more than 2 without hitting inconsistent states - our automated
play/stop/pause monkey tests reliably break DPCM in less than 20s.

The reconfiguration is one problem, but what also happens is that the BE
dailink will see multiple triggers. I've been playing with refcounts to
force consistency and make sure there is only one TRIGGER_START send to
the dailink, and conversely there are cases where the TRIGGER_STOP is
never sent...
