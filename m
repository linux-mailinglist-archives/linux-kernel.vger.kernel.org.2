Ack.

Good enough for me -- it won't matter for DCP, so if it doesn't get any
worse than DCP there's no point in optimizing this.

I was envisioning a macro:

Now that I've typed it out, however, it seems a bit too magical to
justify the minor space savings. And given you need both 32b and 64b
there would be ~4 such macros which is also a lot of boilerplate.

It's not a huge deal either way but I thought I'd raise it.

Fair enough.

Ah! Sure, makes sense. Is it worth adding a few words to the functions
comments indicating this rarely occurs in good conditions?

Probably not worth it, no.

Got it, thanks.

Makes sense for a legacy block üëç
