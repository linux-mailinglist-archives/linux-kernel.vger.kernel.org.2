It's fairly simple on Qualcomm SoCs once audio DSP and modem are working
(which is not that simple). I basically just tell the audio DSP to
stream voice call audio to the audio ports and then it does that without
involving the kernel.

It seems to work quite well, so far no one complained about quality or
something like that. Not sure if anyone is actively using it already
though :)

The work left is mainly making the driver more generic so it can work on
other Qualcomm SoCs as well (right now I have some things hardcoded).
Also, I still haven't fully figured out what is the best way to
integrate it into ASoC/UCM/..., so that it can be easily activated when
starting a voice call.
