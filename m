No worries :)

Ah yes sorry, there are other KernelCI checks for kernel errors
but that wasn't enabled in the bisection so I didn't notice them.

Sure, here's next-20210218 as a reference:

  https://lava.collabora.co.uk/scheduler/job/3241236

and here with your patch applied on top of it:

  https://lava.collabora.co.uk/scheduler/job/3241246

The git branch I've used where your patch is applied:

  https://gitlab.collabora.com/gtucker/linux/-/commits/next-20210218-nyan-big-drm-read/

The errors seem to have disappeared but I'll let you double check
that things are all back to a working state.

BTW: This thread is a good example of how having an "on-demand"
KernelCI service to let developers re-run tests with extra
patches would allow them to fix issues independently.  We'll keep
that in mind for the future.

Best wishes,
Guillaume
