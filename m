Yes, up to some point. But this enforces a particular driver code
(that I've had to change from v6 to v7).

In v6 the gdsc's power_on code would pm_runtime_get() the provider
device, power on the domain and the pm_runtime_put() the provider
device. Thus the gdsc genpd would be powered on (keeping parent
domains in the on state), but the provider device itself would be
runtime-suspended (neat idea by Bjorn). However this relied on changes
in rpmhpd behaviour (which still did not make it to linux-next).

In v7 we have to keep the provider device in resumed state while the
gdsc genpd is powered on (to keep the required-opps vote in place).

I suppose that 'child requires minimum parent's performance state'
might become common property at some point, allowing us to drop this
pm_runtime handling.

Yes, I've had this in the very old iteration of mmcx fixup patchset
(even before mmcx-regulator came into play). It ended up with quite an
ugly piece of code.
