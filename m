To summarize where I think our out-of-band discussion went, I think
you're OK w/ keeping this at "port@1" for both the DP and eDP case and
we'll figure out _some_ way to make it work.

OK, so I looked at that a bit. Fair warning that I've never looked at
the type C code before today so anything I say could be totally wrong!
:-)

...but I _think_ you're abusing the "mux" API for this. I think a type
C port can have exactly 1 mux, right? Right now you are claiming to be
_the_ mux in the DP driver, but what about for other alt modes? If
those wanted to be notified about similar things it would be
impossible because you're already _the_ mux, right?

I _think_ a mux is supposed to be something more like
`drivers/phy/rockchip/phy-rockchip-typec.c` (though that code predates
the type C framework we're looking at here). There the phy can do all
the work of remuxing things / flipping orientation / etc. I don't
think it's a requirement that every SoC be able to do this remuxing
itself but (if memory serves) rk3399 implemented it so we didn't have
to do it on the TCPC and could use a cheaper solution there.

In any case, my point is that I think there is supposed to be a
_single_ mux per port that handles reassigning pins and that's what
this API is for.

...so I will still assert that the right thing to do is to have a
drm_bridge for the type c connector and _that's_ what should be
sending HPD.
