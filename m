There was some use case back in the day where they wanted an indefinite
suppression of RCU CPU stall warnings for the current grace period, but
all the current use cases look fine with restarting the stall timeout.

However, please see below.

This was in fact one of the things I was considering, at least until
I convinced myself that I needed to ask some questions.

One point of possibly unnecessary nervousness on my part is resetting
the start of the grace period, which might confuse diagnostics.

But how about something like this?

void rcu_cpu_stall_reset(void)
{
	WRITE_ONCE(rcu_state.jiffies_stall,
		   jiffies + rcu_jiffies_till_stall_check());
}

Would something like that work?

(One issue with this is if there has already been an RCU CPU stall
warning, in which case the timeout for repeat warnings is tripled.  But in
the current use cases, I don't see that this matters.  If it turns out to
matter, I would just add a flag to rcu_state saying whether the current
grace period had seen a stall, and use that to decide whether or not
to triple the timeout.)
