At least MSM8994 also uses SMC32 from what I heard. Overall it's
probably quite hard to get that right now since all boards were tested
with the dynamic detection so far. I suppose you could do the opposite,
add an optional qcom,scm-64 to skip the detection step and force SMC64.

Also note that this could even be firmware-specific, not necessarily
SoC-specific. There are some ancient MSM8916 firmwares that have legacy
instead of SMC32. I could also imagine that there is also some SoC where
there are different firmware versions with SMC32 or SMC64.

Plus, IMO the overhead for this detection is negligible. At least it
ensures that we always use the right calling convention. The PSCI code
probably does much more firmware calls to figure out all supported
features.
