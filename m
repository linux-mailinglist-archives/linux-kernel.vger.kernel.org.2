Good point!

You mean like this?

	oldstate = start_poll_synchronize_rcu();
	// Why wait?  Beat the rush!!!
	cond_synchronize_rcu(oldstate);

This would be a bit silly (why not just call synchronize_rcu()?),
and yes, this would unconditionally get you an extra RCU grace period.
Then again, any call to cond_synchronize_rcu() before the desired grace
period has expired will get you an extra grace period, and maybe more.

So a given use case either needs to not care about the added latency
or have a high probability of invoking cond_synchronize_rcu() after
the desired grace period has expired.

You got it!
