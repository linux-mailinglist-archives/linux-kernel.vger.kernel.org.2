what if we had a sort of multi-choice panel node:

   panel: panel {
     compatible = "panel,one-of";
     compatible-one-of = "vendor1,panel-a", "vendor2,panel-b",
"vendor3,panel-c";
  };

The kernel could construct power sequence timings that are the
superset of all the possible panels.  That seems about as explicit as
we could get in this sort of case.
