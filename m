You're correct, indeed, I guess we read that a bit too fast.

However, we do see that bumping the reset duration fixes the issue that
was encountered.

To give you more details about this issue, in that scenario the PHY
would fail the autoneg process, no matter how many times we
enable/disable the link and restart autoneg.

The low duration of the reset might put the internal blocks in an
unknown state, but I don't actually have the real hardware-side
explanation for what is actually happening.

Further testing showed, for example, that decreasing the time of reset
assertion to 1ms made the issue appear everytime, whereas bumping it to
10 ms fixed it entirely.

In the absence of any other indication about how long should that reset
be asserted, and after thourough testing, 10ms seems like a good enough
value.

I'll send a V2 with the commit log fixed.

Thanks for the quick review,

Maxime
