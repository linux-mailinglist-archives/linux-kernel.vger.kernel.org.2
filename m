It's a user-visible change in behaviour, isn't it? Therefore we risk
breaking applications that rely on the current behaviour if we change it
unconditionally.

Given that the driver has always worked like this and it doesn't sound like
it's the end of the world to deal with it in userspace (after all, it's
aligned with intel-pt), then I don't think we should change it.
