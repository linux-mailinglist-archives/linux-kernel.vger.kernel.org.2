That would be very ugly code. We would end up in conditional compiles like
#ifdef __s390x__
#endif
and other architectes like ARM/POWER etc come along. This is something I want to avoid.

And this fix only touches perf, not the kernel.

Nope, that line above 'ins_lat = 117.' breaks the test. Comment it out and it works well!!!
That function do_test() is common code executed on all architectures. Take it out and
it is tested nowhere.

The whole purpose of this test test__sample_parsing() --> do_test() is to convert
a perf_sample structure into the perf_event structure and back again. The test
checks if this convertion works in both directions. See perf_event__synthesize_sample()
which flattens an perf_sample structure named sample into an byte stream. Function
evsel__parse_sample() takes that byte stream and creates a struct perf_sample named
sample_out.
perf_event__synthesize_sample() has as input sample.ins_lat with value 117.
And evsel__parse_sample() creates samples_out with  sample_out.ins_lat value 0.
So the test breaks. Thats why we need to set ins_lat in both functions.

I just looked at this patch.
As far I as understand the code, the weak functions just set sample member weight and
do not touch member ins_lat. Sample member weight is a 64 bit value. 
It is used when sample_type has bit PERF_SAMPLE_WEIGHT set.

What we need is sample member ins_lat being set. This is the case when sample_type
has bit PERF_SAMPLE_WEIGHT_STRUCT set. On x86 the sample member weight
is split into a lower 32bit value containing weight value and an upper 32 bit
value containing ins_lat value. x86 hardware obviously does not provide larger values.

We need to do the same for non_x86 platforms. Otherwise member ins_lat is never set
and the test fails. Since the weak functions are only called when architecture specific
functions are not available, that hardware is not there to support this. 
So why don't we use this
procedure when we run into the weak functions where is is no hardware support anyway???
