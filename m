I see. We use this heavily for entry to EDL use-cases.

We do require the mhi_pm_sys_err_handler() to be called in those cases
as any entry to PBL/EDL means there is need to clean-up MHI host and 
notify all
its clients.

We include PTHRU in here because its a SYS ERROR in PBL modes.

Premise being the controller should not be in that business of doing any 
of
the clean-up that is responsibility of the core driver. We're using this 
feature
set to ensure controller is only notified.

What does AIC100 do on fatal error that you run in to issues? I don't 
think
any of the other controllers do anything other than disabling runtime PM 
since
device is down. Maybe there's some room for improvement.

Thanks,
Bhaumik
