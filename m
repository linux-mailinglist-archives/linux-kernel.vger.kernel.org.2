Not sure why, I see it on lore:

I have added slice and bpp info in the DT here under the host and then
pass the generic struct drm_dsc_config to panel which allows panel to
write the pps cmd

Nothing above is MSM specific.. It can very well work with non MSM
controllers too.

I didn't envision DSC to be a specific thing, most of
the patches here are hardware enabling ones for DSC bits for MSM
hardware.

I dont have an answer for that right now, to start with yes the
properties are in host but I am okay to discuss this and put wherever we
feel is most correct thing.  I somehow dont like that we should pull
from panel DT and program host with that. Here using struct
drm_dsc_config allows me to configure panel based on resolution passed

But you must read from somewhere like ACPI tables. I think ACPI systems
would have some ACPI table info out there which would help on this.
Yes that is another task which we need to start with once we enable OF
systems.
