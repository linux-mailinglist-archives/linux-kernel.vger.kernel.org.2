To clarify, I'm asking about CPU capabilities.  Are there any AMD CPUs
with the PSF feature, which don't have SSB?

I didn't see any actual examples.  Are you referring to this sentence?

  "PSFD may be desirable for software which is concerned with the
   speculative behavior of PSF but desires a smaller performance impact
   than setting SSBD."

No, since PSF can already be mitigated with SSBD today, I'm suggesting
that all code be removed from the patch and instead just update the
documentation.
