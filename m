agreed, but this will incur extra costs, we should perhaos use perf to
measure how much it costs. :-)

Ok

So you could first do a prep patch converting functions to have gotos,
which would be a no-logic change, and then do the rest?

So we should break it in as many small steps as possible, knowing that
each step is fixing just one of the problems, i.e. aSAN will continue
reporting problems, but less problems as you go on adding more fixes.

See above, thanks for working on this!
