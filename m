I'm not generally opposed to having another maintainer to take patches
for the times I'm out or get hit by a bus. However, I don't feel like
being bullied into this.

Between off-list emails, attempts to go behind my back emailing people
complaining about me, declaring himself maintainer and pro-claiming
there's a new repo for linux-fpga over the last year and some, I've just
about had enough of this sh*t. This is not how this works.

There are plenty of folks around that also help out and that I'd much
rather work with at this point -- if just to skip the drama.

So for now NAK on this patch from my end.

Cheers,
Moritz
