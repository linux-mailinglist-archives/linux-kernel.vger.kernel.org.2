Right, that sounds reasonable.

What do you mean by "exposed"? It sounds like you are saying that
"MDSS_GDSC" is an artificial power domain, no?

If that's the case, more exactly, why is it like this?

My apologies if I bother you with details, but as a maintainer of
genpd, it is very useful to me to have the complete picture.

Yes, I noticed the patches you posted. Thanks for helping out here!

I agree!
