Maybe, although that looks like a specialized error for corner cases.

Yep.

Heh, yeah that's complicated. I guess we should use one flag per file as that
fits well within the current cpuset design. But we must carefully choose the new
files to make sure they have the least chances to be useless in the long term.

I suspect we should avoid that at all costs :-)

Thanks!
