What do you mean by "trip"?

And how are the different devices related?

What type of bluetooth device is this, and what does it have to do with
the serial port?  Is the SoC device using the same IP blocks for both?

No idea, sorry, as you have the hardware, you have the best chance of
debugging this :(

good luck!
