I'm by no means an expert on this, but the main thing I have in mind is that
(IIUC) the "fips" option is only useful if your whole kernel binary is certified
as a "FIPS cryptographic module", *and* you actually need the FIPS compliance.
And the upstream kernel doesn't have a FIPS certification out of the box; that's
a task for specific Linux distributors like Red Hat, SUSE, Ubuntu, who get
specific kernel binaries certified.

So, compiling a kernel and using the "fips" option is useless by itself, as your
kernel image won't actually have a FIPS certification in that case anyway.

So, I would expect an explanation like that about under what circumstances the
"fips" option is actually useful and intended for.

The people who actually use this option should be able to explain it properly
though; the above is just my understanding...
