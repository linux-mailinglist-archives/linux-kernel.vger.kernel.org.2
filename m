I believe Sato-san has one for the new landisks.
Mine is also using the hacked up lilo, with kexec to boot into a modern
kernel.  Unfortunately kexec is broken upstream (since ages), so I cannot
kexec from a modern kernel to a modern kernel.

Should be doable with earlycon.

Yeah, I agree the Ecovec24 (and the SH7722-based Migo-R) should be
kept alive.

You mean "[PATCH] SH: Add dma mask for sh_eth on ecovec24."[1]?
Do you still need that patch? Probably this was fixed in the core
core, after the
initial dma_mask breakage.
