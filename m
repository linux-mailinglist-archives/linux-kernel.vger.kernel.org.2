Hey Andy,

On behalf of Ross and myself I wanted to follow up on the points raised 
here. While there is an interest to ensure a system is properly 
configured we should not be blocking the user from configuring the 
system as they desire. Instead we are taking the approach to document 
the SecureLaunch capability, in particular the recommend way to 
configure the kernel to appropriately use the capability using the 
already existing methods such as using kernel parameters. Hopefully that 
will address the concerns in the short term. Looking forward, we do have 
a vested interest in ensuring there is an ability to configure access 
control for security and safety critical solutions and would be grateful 
if we would be included in any discussions or working groups that might 
be looking into unifying how all these security technologies should be 
configuring the Linux kernel.

V/r,
Daniel P. Smith
