Well, no. Here, events are kind of independent entities. PCM-related
events are just a special case of more generic events, which can carry
any kind of notification/payload. (And at the moment, only XRUN
notification is supported for PCM substreams.) So it has nothing to do
with the atomicity of the PCM device itself.

Yeah, we can take a look into some kind of optimizations here. But I
suspect, the overall code will look similar. It is not enough just to
get a list of pages, you also need to build a list of physically
contiguous regions from it. Because the sg-elements are put into a
virtqueue that has a limited size. And each sg-element consumes one item
in the virtqueue. And since the virtqueue itself is shared between all
substreams, the items of the virtqueue become a scarce resource.

That's one of options. Since the same info can be derived from sg-list,
I thought it might be not necessary to keep it in some additional field.
But probably it makes sense to keep total length in the message
structure itself. Then it will be more flexible (if we will need to
create non-period sized messages in the future).
