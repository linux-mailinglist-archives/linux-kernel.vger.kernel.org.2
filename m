I disagree.

The DT bindings you defined (thanks for the direct link) are MSM
specific.  I'm not talking (yet) about the properties you defined, but
purely from the stand point that you defined the binding within the
scope of the MSM dsi binding.  No other vendor can use those bindings.
Of course, if we look at the properties themselves, they are prefixed
with "qcom", which is vendor specific.

So, purely on the face of it, this is MSM specific.

Assuming we want a DT solution for DSC, I think it should be something
like Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt (the
first example that comes to mind), which is a non-vendor specific
generic set of properties that each vendor/device specific binding can
inherit.  Panel has similar things.

Specific to the properties, I don't much like that you duplicate BPP,
which is already associated with the panel (although perhaps not in
the scope of DT).  What if the panel and your DSC bindings disagree?
Also, I guess I need to ask, have you read the DSC spec?  Last I
looked, there were something like 3 dozen properties that could be
configured.  You have five in your proposed binding.  To me, this is
not a generic DSC solution, this is MSM specific (and frankly I don't
think this supports all the configuration the MSM hardware can do,
either).

I'm surprised Rob Herring didn't have more to say on this.

I somewhat agree that pulling from the panel and programing the host
based on that is an odd solution, but we have it currently.  Have a
look at Documentation/devicetree/bindings/display/panel in particular
panel-timing.  All of that ends up informing the mdss programing
anyways (particularly the dsi and its phy).  So my problem is that we
currently have a solution that seems to just need to be extended, and
instead you have proposed a completely different solution which is
arguably contradictory.

However, I'd like to see thoughts from Rob Clark, David, and any
others that typically handle this stuff (maybe Sam Ravenborg from the
panel side?).  I consider them to be the experts, and if they think
your solution is the way to go, I'll shut up.  I consider myself to be
a novice that has dabbled in this area, and while this currently
doesn't make sense to me, maybe I need some education here to see the
light.

Frankly, I don't like the MSM ACPI solution that I've seen on the laptops.
The ACPI assumes the entire MDSS (including DSI parts) and GPU is one
device, and ultimately handled by one driver.  That driver needs to
get a value from UEFI (set by the bootloader) that is the "panel id".
Then the driver calls into ACPI (I think its _ROM, but I might be
mistaken, doing this from memory) with that id.  It gets back a binary
blob which is mostly an xml file (format is publicly documented) that
contains the panel timings and such.

Generally we've defined simple-panel entities for these, with the
timings in code (you can see what Bjorn and I have upstreamed), and
just match on the compatible.

In summary, I don't mean to be difficult, I just think this solution
needs more "baking".
