Thus far we've been able to successfully reverse engineer it on x86,
though it hasn't been easy.

There were some particulars for arm64 which made doing so impossible.
(I don't remember the details.)

I thought Android already relied on OOT modules.

GCC plugins generally enforce the exact same GCC version for OOT
modules.  So there's no ABI to worry about.  I assume Clang does the
same?

Or did I miss your point?

I like the idea.  Is there a recommended forum for such discussions?
Just an email to GCC/Clang development lists?
