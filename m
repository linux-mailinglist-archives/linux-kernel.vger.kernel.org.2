Hi Leo,

I had a couple of questions about this bit. If we're assuming that the
high bytes of 'first' and 'last' are equal, then 'second' is supposed
to be somewhere in between or equal to 'first' and 'last'.

If that's the case, wouldn't it be better to return 'last', because it's
closer to the value at the time of reading? And then in that case, if
last is returned, then why do a read for 'second' at all? Can 'second' be
skipped and just read first and last?

Also maybe it won't make a difference, but is there a missing smp_rmb()
between the read of 'last' and 'first'?

Thanks
James
