The channel of 4 Sid. Sid (cursive) is a correct translation of the 
arabic Dia ( É¯I  ) of The Quran. And why related culture was more rational.
Fair Buds from the original (Nix, Digital Mars, C64, Amiga, Team 17, 
C-Lab, A-Eon, Be, Open Source, Go etc.) culture, that became most 
professional with Game Prog and Rave (Maruf not Munkar production 
principles). With LOL media also popular  at the end of the 90s, often a 
criticism of The Hemp-Dia. And common later is Retro Scene media. 80s 
Disco and New Wave early influence.

The Sevu icon being its symbol.

Nice False Jewels (94) inspired stuff. This project I produced, and do 
others (such as Retro Bit, and others if noted.).

Advanced: Read my research page.

Serenity.
