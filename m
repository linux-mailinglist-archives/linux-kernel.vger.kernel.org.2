Well, the trick in glubi (and other MTDs with "hotplug" support) is not to reject
removal of the sub-device. ->_put_device() is of return type void.
The key is grabbing a reference on the sub-device in ->_get_device() such that
the layer below doesn't even try to remove while the MTD is in use.

Can you point us to the affected code?
This would help a lot to understand the issue better.
I'm sure we can find a solution.

Thanks,
