That's not automatically clear to me.  There are plenty of places
where an interrupt borrows the context of the task that it happens to
have interrupted.  Specifically, interrupts should be using GFP_ATOMIC
anyway, so this doesn't really make a lot of sense, but I don't think
it's necessarily wrong for an interrupt to call a function that says
"Definitely don't make GFP_FS allocations between these two points".
