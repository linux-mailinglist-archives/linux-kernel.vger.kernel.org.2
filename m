Thanks everyone for comments.

Let me steer the discussion to original topic - it's about old kernel
and new DTB, assuming that mainline kernel bisectability is not
affected.

Flow looks like this:

0. You have existing bidings and drivers.
1. Patch changing bindings (with new compatible) and drivers gets
   accepted by maintainer.
2. Patch above (bindings+drivers) goes during merge window to v5.11-rc1.
3. Patch changing in-tree DTS to new compatible gets accepted by
   maintainer and it is sent as v5.12-rc1 material to SoC maintainers.

So again: old kernel, using old bindings, new DTB.

Another case is where out-of-tree user of bindings, e.g. FreeBSD, takes
new DTS (at point of #3 above or later) but did not take the bindings.
Such system would be broken but it's their fault - they took DTS without
taking the bindings (which were there already for one release!).

Best regards,
Krzysztof
