Well, I'd not hold up the existing userspace I'm using as sacrosanct
(AOSP devices still usually don't have to work cross-kernel versions -
devboards being the main exception). I'm fine if we can rework
userland as proposed, so that the issues can be avoided, but I
honestly don't have enough context to really understand what that
looks like (no idea what udc aliases are).

And whatever we do, the main constraint is that userland has to be
able to work with existing LTS kernels and newer kernels.

It may be backwards compatible, but I'm still not clear exactly how it
would work.

I guess if we look through all
sys/bus/platform/devices/*/of_node/compatbile strings for the desired
"snps,dwc3", then find which of the directories have the desired
address in the string? (The suggestion for looking at reg seems
better, but I don't get a char value out of the dwc3 of_node/reg
file).

It seems much more straightforward to do an `ls /sys/class/udc/$GADGET_ADDR.*`

But again, if folks decide the names can be rearranged to usb.<addr>
in the future, that would break too.
