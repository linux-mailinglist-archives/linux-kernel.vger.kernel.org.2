While I really don't care(evident by rate at which I worked on this ðŸ˜‰)
I think Hector Yuan won't be happy to wait I guess. As a quick fix, you
can update "qcom,cpufreq-hw" to "mediatek,cpufreq-hw". You will still
get warning with this patch + update alone, but once you have Hector's
mediatek cpufreq driver applied, the warnings must disappear.

What do you think ?
