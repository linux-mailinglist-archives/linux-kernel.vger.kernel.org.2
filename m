I don't think there's much in the log other than the EFI stub above.

Is this actual trace? It would be good to know where exactly it got
stuck.

I wonder whether the memblock_mark_nomap() here is too early for
kmemleak. We don't have the linear map created, though it shouldn't be
an issue as the kernel sections are mapped. Also I think
delete_object_part() in kmemleak.c would bail out early as there
shouldn't be any prior memblock_alloc for this range.
