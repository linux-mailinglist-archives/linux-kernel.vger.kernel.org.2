Ok i will send a new revision including only this ones, and continue the updates
in a new patchset.

From my windows, there are 3 remaining features:
- capability to instantiate rpmsg_chrdev from the remote side (NS announcement)
- capability to instantiate rpmsg_chrdev from local user application
  (RPMSG_CREATE_DEV_IOCTL)
- capability to send a NS announcement to the remote side on  rpmsg_chrdev local
instantiation using RPMSG_CREATE_DEV_IOCTL. This one could be more tricky to
implement as the endpoint can be created after the channel.

To simplify the review while keeping the overall picture in mind (and perhaps
prioritize based on other companies' interests), Please, just tell me what would
be your preference in term of splitting and next step.

Yes the rpmsg_chrdev should be the default one to use for basic communication.
The main purpose of the RPMSG_TTY (from ST company POW) is to easy the
transition in term of communication between an external and an internal
processor based on a serial link. It provides an abstraction layer that the
application does not have to manage the transport layer.

Both seem to me interesting to implement, but let's continue to focus on
rpmsg_chrdev first.

Arnaud
