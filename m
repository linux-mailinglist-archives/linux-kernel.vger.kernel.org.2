This is not a highly performance sensitive read workload.

I'm not sure about this argument, or that RCU should be used only for
highly performance sensitive read workloads. Can you please elaborate on
the argument above and also put your statement in perspective with
https://lwn.net/Articles/263130/?

@Christian: Since you proposed RCU for this, I guess your opinion
does not align with Jason's.

Yes a simple sleepable lock would work, and we wouldn't need
get_module(). Because before the vfio_ap module unloads, it
sets all vcpu->kvm->arch.crypto.pqap_hook instances to NULL. So if
we know that vcpu->kvm->arch.crypto.pqap_hook then we know
that the still have valid references to the module.

I tend to agree. In fact I asked for a lock around it several times:
https://www.lkml.org/lkml/2019/3/1/260
https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/12/3/987
https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/12/4/994

But in my opinion RCU is also viable (not this patch). I think, I prefer
a lock for simplicity, unless it is not (deadlocks) ;).

Many thanks for bringing your perspective to this. I'm optimistic about
getting this finally addressed properly.

Halil
