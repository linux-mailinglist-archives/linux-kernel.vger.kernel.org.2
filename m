get_ucounts() in the __sigqueue_alloc() performs the get_uid() function
but does not ignore the counter overflow. Basically get_uid() can fail in
same way as get_ucounts(), but we just ignore it.

Waaaait. task_ucounts() is a different thing. This function only gets a
field from the task structure without any reference counting. But the
get_ucounts() is more like get_user_ns() or get_uid(), but does not ignore
counter overflow.

Earlier I tried to use refcount_t which never returns errors [1]. We
talked and you said that ignoring counter overflow errors is bad
design for this case.
