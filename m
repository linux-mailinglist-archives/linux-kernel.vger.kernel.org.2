 From a process granular point of view I believe a /proc/self approach solves
this problem at root. However, as you have stated too; applications will now
have to look at another interface for the correct information and that could
potentially be a challenge.

In our experimentation and survey we found out that container applications which
were restricted based on a cgroup restriction - both cpuset or period/quota
benefited from coherent information. That was also my understanding with the
usage of tools like LXCFS in the userspace.

Would you happen to know if there are any applications that expect the full
hardware/topology view even though it itself is restricted in its usage?

I agree, cgroup is a control interface and should not be used for presenting of
information and cgroups may not be the only thing in the system controlling
access to the resources.

This is where the idea for a different interface really stemmed from.
That although there are mechanisms to restrict and control usage, there is no
interface that presents information coherently to the userspace

I concur with this approach to build an application first interface.

My current frame of reference for the problems come from tools like LXCFS which
are built around the existing interfaces to present information and the
experiments were designed to quantify those shortcomings.
We could definitely use some help in understanding the shortcomings of the
current interfaces from people who use these applications.
