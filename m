Then FPGA manager driver, one of Intel service layer driver's client, can decide whether to handle the newly added bitstream authentication function based on the retrieved firmware version. So that we can maintain FPGA manager driver the back compatible.

Ok, as mentioned on the other thread. Let's replace the overlay code
with a sysfs entry for dry-run or verify-image or something of that
sort.

I don't see what the overlay mechanism adds in this case since we're not
trying to load drivers.
