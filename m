Subject: [RFC PATCH] soc: qcom: socinfo: import PMIC IDs from pmic-spmi
Date:   Tue,  4 May 2021 22:37:53 +0200
Message-Id: <20210504203752.95555-1-luca@z3ntu.xyz>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.31.1
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The driver in drivers/mfd/qcom-spmi-pmic.c has a more complete and more
up-to-date list of PMICs with the respective IDs. Use those names for
socinfo.

I'm sending this as RFC because I'm not sure what names are correct for
the IDs that I've replaced (13, 16, 17, 20, 21, 24).
For PM8941, PM8841, PM8226 and PMA8084 I'm quite sure that the IDs are
correct, but I don't have devices with the other PMICs. Please advise
what to do.
