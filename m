Yeah, I think I will introduce a struct to aid with this and some others

The first 4 bytes are used regardless if writev() or write() is used.
Both turn into an iterator to make the code simpler instead of handling
each case differently.

No, they need 0-N fields, perhaps I should leave off the second field in

The idea is to allow user mode processes to describe their own data
types if required. For that we need offset or size to be passed. If we
require all user mode to only describe in types the kernel understands
then I can remove the size field.

Got it, does that mean I should just reference it here as a new type?
I'm not sure what it means to add __rel_loc type since it appears anyone
can pass any type down to trace_event and it will accept it.

Sorry, are you asking for several isolated patches? Or a single patch
with multiple commits to the same file?

Typically after addition I am running a set of tests and benchmarks
against the code, so having full functioning code is required to ensure
I haven't broken anything.

We are actively using these patches for various projects, which require
ftrace, perf and eBPF to be functional.

I have this for custom user types the kernel may not know the size of.
Another reason is 32-bit process on a 64-bit kernel. The size will always be
the kernel size of that type.

If we don't care about either, then I can remove this. For custom types
we are fine with using __rel_loc instead.

We have several events that describe the print format to use instead of
using the default, like we allow in the kernel. This is currently how it
is passed, it could be described in the new struct to the reg ioctl
instead.

We want to enable certain sensitive events the ability to mark that
there should never be a buffer copy. When FLAG_BPF_ITER is used the raw
iovecs are exposed out to eBPF instead of any sort of copy to reduce
latency. We run user_events in some highly performant code and want to
monitor things with the least amount of overhead possible.

Ok, the reason we do this is because the events are going to be
versioned. They might change their arguments and having a way to clear
without knowing the exact arguments is not a bad thing in our cases.

No one can remove an event while it's being used and the name cannot
conflict since all user events go to the user_events sub-system and
cannot be overriden.

My understanding was that preemption is to be disabled when using rcu
protected by sched, which tracepoints and the refs are. We also want the
correct processor to log the event (as near as we can).

Did I misunderstand rcu_dereference_sched_check()? I may be off in the
weeds.

I also ran with CONFIG_PROVE_RCU and didn't see anything show up in
dmesg.

Sure, everywhere else had this and wasn't sure if this was possible to
happen or not. I'll remove it.

Yes, if we need to fault in data we want the data to come in. This is in
the user process context of write() and writev() which I believe is the
expected target for copy_from_iter().

During the probe copies we are not holding a lock or have interrupts
disabled, under what circumstances would a page fault cause an issue in
these paths? What is recommended here if we want to have page faults be
allowed (Hoping they are rare)?

Yes, this avoids double copying of the data in the normal paths. Moving
to a temp buffer only really changes 1 line in the probe functions
(copy_from_iter to copy_from_user).

If I were to create a temp buffer for simplicity I guess I would have to
kmalloc on each call or move to a per-cpu buffer or use stack memory and
limit how much data can be copied.

These would likely add more lines than they remove from the code.

Callers are free to call the reg ioctl while a write is occurring on the
same file. This can cause the kernel to access garbage. Either RCU or
locking is required in these paths or the ABI needs a way to lock the
file into a mode where no more events can be added (IE: Change to write
mode).

We want RCU because we have places where multiple processors will be
emitting data out to the same file. We don't want the data/cache
contention across processors to slow things down, which we have seen in
other telemetry data.

Because user_events_ref_add use rcu protected by sched. It appears that
preemption is supposed to be disabled when using that from my read of
the code. Is this not correct or not required?

If you are talking about this specific call site (user_events_release)
then yeah I believe I can remove it. If you talking in general, we use
RCU to protect against some scenarios where events are getting
registered while previous events are getting written out.

We chose RCU over readwrite locking due to potential for shared cache
contention related slowdowns.
