Correct, we are just checking for obvious bugs. The bigger problem is 
the usability and potentially performance impact.

In other words when you set this value to high the list_add() function 
will use so much time that the kernel thinks that the CPU is stuck. I've 
was already able to trigger this.

Would it be more acceptable if I drop the config option and only allow 
to override the check on a per C file basis?

I have seen plenty of those. Especially when you implement state 
machines when a certain object needs to move from state to state 
triggered by external events.

For example it seems to be a common mistake to do a list_del_init, drop 
a lock and then assume a list_add should do it when you re-aquired the 
lock. In reality you have a very small window where a device interrupt 
could have already added the item to the list again between the locks.

Thanks,
Christian.
