Hi Leo,

Now that you mention arguments, I remembered that you already can force something like that
with --disable-order.

There is also a recent commit "perf intel-pt: Support Z itrace option for timeless decoding"
which introduces this option:

	@@ -869,6 +869,7 @@ The letters are:
	     	L	synthesize last branch entries on existing event records
	 	s	skip initial number of events
	 	q	quicker (less detailed) decoding
	+	Z	prefer to ignore timestamps (so-called "timeless" decoding)

I will investigate if these are more relevant to fix this issue.


Thanks
James
