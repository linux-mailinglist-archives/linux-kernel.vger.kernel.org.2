I think that x86 always succeeding here is more of a legacy thing that
they're stuck with rather than a design to be copied.

I'd prefer to keep the existing meaning of the `long` flag to mean "give
me 64 bits of counter, somehow", with `rdpmc` meaning "give me a single
counter I can access from userspace", even if that means the combination
of the two can sometimes be rejected. As you say, we can probe for that
as necessary by trying `long` then falling back to a plain event, and if
that ends up being a bottleneck somehow we can figure out a way of
advertising support to userspace. Regardless, we should 

Importantly, I don't think libperf should override a user's request for
`long`, since the user may want to optimize for minimal perturbation
rather than faster access.

If we want a "please give me the longest counter that's compatible with
other constraints", I think that should be a new flag e.g. `trylong`,
and shouldn't override the existing `long`. We can add that as a
follow-up if we want it.

Thanks,
Mark.
