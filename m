Correct. Note that 1 thread stuck in the read is already sufficient to
get into this.
Most of the heavy processing is done at medium priority and the
background tasks are running at the low priority.
Since the background tasks are implemented by scripts, a lot of
accesses to the read part are done at low prio.

The current system has 1 CPU with 2 cores but we have also devices
with 14 cores on which the impact will be bigger of course.
Note that with the rtmutex solution all accesses (read + write) will
be serialized.

I wonder why other people do not see this issue since it is present in
all kernel versions.
And, especially in systems with strict deadlines, I consider this a
serious issue.
