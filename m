No need for that, I'm already named as the generic sound/* stuff
maintainer.  And, it's rather more about how the merge gets pushed up
to upstream.  In general, the stuff belonging to a subsystem goes via
the subsystem tree, e.g. Mark has been maintaining ASoC stuff in his 
tree while it gets merged sound.git tree to Linus.  Similarly, it's
fine if Michael wants to keep a sub-subsystem tree for virtio_snd,
too.  But keeping a dedicated git repo for a single driver isn't often
worthwhile.

Of course, it's no strict rule, and I don't mind if anybody has a
strong reason to process in other ways, too.  Just let me know.


thanks,

Takashi
