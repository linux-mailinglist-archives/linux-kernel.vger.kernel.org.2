Hi Mimi,
Sorry for the late response.
I wanted to spend some time thinking what other scenarios I could test.
Responses below.

Sure, I can add the 4th line to the list:

For example,
     - i_version is not enabled,
     - i_generation changed,
     - an inode is evicted from dcache,
     - same file present on different filesystems, with different i_ino
       etc.

Should I spin up v5 of this patch with the updated patch description?

I was also thinking if I should cover any other scenarios, and
soft-links/hard-links seemed like a good scenario to test - so I went
ahead and tested it. And it looks like the patch is working as expected
in this scenario.

Here are the detailed findings:

If I have a file original.txt, and create a soft-link file -
softlink.txt,

(1) only original.txt is reported in IMA log, regardless if I touch
     original.txt or softlink.txt.
     This is true in both cases - when allow_dup is turned on or off.
     (i.e. with or without this patch)
(2) duplicate entries are measured only when allow_dup is turned on.

If I have a file original.txt, and create a hard-link file -
hardlink.txt,
(1) whichever file I touch first, either original.txt or hardlink.txt,
     gets measured in IMA log, both when allow_dup is turned on or off.
     (i.e. with or without this patch)
(2) duplicate entries are measured only when allow_dup is turned on.

Since the the observed behavior is identical in both cases,
soft-links and hard-links (1), and duplicates are measured only when
allow_dup is turned on as expected (2), I don't believe we should call
out soft-links/hard-links in the list above. It is not a special case
like ones mentioned in the list.

Please let me know if you think otherwise.

Thanks,
Tushar
