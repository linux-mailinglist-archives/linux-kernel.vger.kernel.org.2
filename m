Thinking more about this, I believe there is a use case for synthetic
event on a eprobe. Basically:

  normal_event -> eprobe (extracts struct data into $dat) -> onmax($dat) -> synthetic event

But I can not come up with any use case of:

  eprobe -> synthetic event -> eprobe

or

  synthetic event -> eprobe -> synthetic event

That's because once you have an eprobe, you can extract what you want,
and once you have that synthetic event, you can get the data you want.

Maybe we should prevent the above and allow one eprobe on a synthetic
event and one synthetic event on an eprobe.

Or just don't prevent it at all, and let the user shoot themselves in
the foot ;-)

The more I think about this, I'm thinking we just let them shoot
themselves if they want to.

But I still agree that eprobes should not be attached to kprobes or
uprobes directly (although they may be able to be attached to a
synthetic event that is attached to one!)
