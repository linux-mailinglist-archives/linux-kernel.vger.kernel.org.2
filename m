I'm ok with your preference as long as we have some way to log these 
MMIO accesses.

Sorry, I didn't get this part, so  I am trying this on ARM64:

arm64/include/asm/io.h has read{b,l,w,q} defined.
include/asm-generic/io.h has below:
   #ifndef readl
   #define readl readl
   static inline u32 readl(const volatile void __iomem *addr)

and we include asm-generic/io.h in arm64/include/asm/io.h at the end 
after the definitions for arm64 mmio accesors.
So arch implementation here overrides generic ones as I see it, am I 
missing something? I even confirmed this
with some trace_printk to generic and arch specific definitions of readl 
and I see arch specific ones being called.

Thanks,
Sai
