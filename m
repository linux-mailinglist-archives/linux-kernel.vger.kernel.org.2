Here are more context and testing details:

This issue was originally identified in Amazon Linux 2 with kernel 5.10 and
CONFIG_HZ is 250 in x86_64 while 100 in arm64. It can be reproduced by launching
EC2 instances c5.2xlarge (x86_64) and c6g.2xlarge (arm64) then measuring time to
finish ext4lazyinit thread after mounting the ext4 FS.

w/o fix in kernel 5.10
|----------------+-------------+------------|
| ext4 FS volume | c6g.2xlarge | c5.2xlarge |
|----------------+-------------+------------|
| 2T             | 1842 secs   | 743 secs   |
|----------------+-------------+------------|
| 3T             | 2690 secs   | 1110 secs  |
|----------------+-------------+------------|

w/ fix in kernel 5.10
|----------------+-------------+------------|
| ext4 FS volume | c6g.2xlarge | c5.2xlarge |
|----------------+-------------+------------|
| 2T             | 660 secs    | 544 secs   |
|----------------+-------------+------------|
| 3T             | 1053 secs   | 932 secs   |
|----------------+-------------+------------|
