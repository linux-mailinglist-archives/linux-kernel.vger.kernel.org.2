Hi Lee, mfd reviewers,

This new driver depends on three regmap-irq framework changes that have
been accepted by Mark (please see above) and hence will land only in the
next rc-1 release. I just wanted to make sure that this patch series was
on your radar [1]. The dt-bindings has been Acked by Rob already, and
I'd be happy to address any review comments while patiently waiting for
the dependencies to land.

Thank you.

Guru Das.
