We "know" that kn->name will not overflow here based on the callers of
this function, right?  I can not find any caller that passes in a buffer
that would overflow, or am I missing a callpath somewhere?

But in the existing kernel, can that happen today?  I can't find any
caller that would be using this in that manner.

And that's what matters.  Not the theoretical callers in the possible
future, but the in-kernel users of the functions today.

If these calls are wrong, then they should be fixed, but adding another
string function to the heap of ones we have should only be done after
considering the ones that we currently have, why they were added, and
why existing code has not yet been converted to use them.

thanks,
