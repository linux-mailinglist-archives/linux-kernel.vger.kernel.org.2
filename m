Returning the entire contents of the buffer once the first wrap-around
was detected was the intention of the patch, so I don't currently see it
as wrong. What were the values you were expecting to see in the test?

If the handling of snapshot mode by the perf tool can be improved after
upstreaming the changes to the driver, we could submit a followup patch
after that has been fixed.

I will try these and the other driver changes and discuss them with the
team internally, thanks!
