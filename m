Well, I don't want to preclude it in the API.  I'm not sure about that
specific example, but in most cases it should be possible to run the
PAPR vIOMMU on an x86 IOMMU backend.  Obviously only something you'd
want to do for testing and experimentation, but it could be quite
useful for that.

Erm.. I don't really know how your IOASID interface works here.  I'm
thinking about the VFIO interface where maps and unmaps are via
explicit ioctl()s, which provides an obvious point to do translation
between page table formats.

But.. even if you're exposing page tables to userspace.. with hardware
that has explicit support for nesting you can probably expose the hw
tables directly which is great for the cases that works for.  But
surely for older IOMMUs which don't do nesting you must have some way
of shadowing guest IO page tables to host IO page tables to translate
GPA to HPA at least?  If you're doing that, I don't see that
converting page table format is really any harder

The trick is that you don't necessarily need dynamic window support in
the backend to emulate it in the vIOMMU.  If your backend has fixed
windows, then you emulate request window as:
	if (requested window is within backend windows)
		no-op;
	else
		return ERROR;

It might not be a theoretically complete emulation of the vIOMMU, but
it can support in-practice usage.  In particular it works pretty well
if your backend has a nice big IOVA range (like x86 IOMMUS) but your
guest platform typically uses relatively small IOVA windows.  PAPR on
x86 is exactly that... well.. possibly not the 64-bit window, but
because of old PAPR platforms that didn't support that, we can choose
not to advertise that and guests will cope.
