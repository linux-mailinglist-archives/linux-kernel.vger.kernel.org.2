OK, so this is predicated on the idea that a guest will not use all of
its assigned RAM and that the host will put that RAM to good use
elsewhere.  Right?

That's undercut by a a few of factors:
1. Many real-world cloud providers do not overcommit RAM.  If the guest
   does not use the RAM, it goes to waste.  (Yes, there are providers
   that overcommit, but we're talking generally about places where this
   proposal is useful).
2. Long-term, RAM fills up with page cache in many scenarios

So, this is really only beneficial for long-term host physical memory
use if:
1. The host is overcommitting
and
2. The guest never uses all of its RAM

Seeing as TDX doesn't support swap and can't coexist with persistent
memory, the only recourse for folks overcommitting TDX VMs when the run
out of RAM is to kill VMs.

I can't imagine that a lot of folks are going to do this.

In other words, I buy the boot speed argument.  But, I don't buy the
"this saves memory long term" argument at all.

That's good information.  It's a refinement of the "I want to boot
faster" requirement.  What you want is not just going _faster_, but
being able to run userspace before full acceptance has completed.

Would you be able to quantify how fast TDX page acceptance is?  Are we
talking about MB/s, GB/s, TB/s?  This series is rather bereft of numbers
for a feature which making a performance claim.

Let's say we have a 128GB VM.  How much does faster does this approach
reach userspace than if all memory was accepted up front?  How much
memory _could_ have been accepted at the point userspace starts running?
