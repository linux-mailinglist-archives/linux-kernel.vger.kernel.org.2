Tried again, another boom. This time I managed to capture a stack trace
(scrolled out at the top, but it's the same as before and easily reproducible):

This is a heavily patched 5.10.x, but it's been perfectly stable so far
until I added this last patch; the one before was avoid-circular-stable-merges.
Maybe an unintentional side effect? In any case all I see is bfq_delta() inlined
into bfq_calc_finish() and exploding since entity->weight is apparently 0.

Hope this helps.
