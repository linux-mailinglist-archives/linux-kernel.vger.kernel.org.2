Nice explanation, and thanks for the below figures. So I guess there is some kind of "small SRAM" that is
directly addressable perhaps?

I think I'm fine with your series now. Just a small nit: next time you send a series, please update the version number "[PATCH v6]" (automatically added with the -v6 parameter in git-format-patch). But no need to resend just for that.
