read() isn't quite as interesting because (usually) there's no effect if
you abort a read part way through (you can easily roll back the file
position and return an error). Although I believe it does have the same
behaviour as write() in the cases of errors where rollback doesn't
happen. write()[1] has the following text:

which matches the behaviour here - if there's an error (e.g. disk full)
then the partial success is reported (and the error effectively
ignored). The caller can then make another call to attempt the remaining
part at which point the error will actually be reported.

[1] https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html

I tried to keep the Returns section reasonably small. It does state
"number of bytes copied" which I think gives the reader a hint that the
return could be different from the number of bytes requested.
