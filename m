FROM MR.ZERBO YAMEOGO
AUDIT& ACCOUNT MANAGER
BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A)
OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA FASO
WEST AFRICA.

Dear Friend,

With due respect, I have decided to contact you on a business transaction
that will be beneficial to both of us. At the bank last account and
auditing evaluation, my staffs came across an old account which was being
maintained by a foreign client who we learn was among the deceased
passengers of motor accident on November.2003, the deceased was unable to
run this account since his death. The account has remained dormant without
the knowledge of his family since it was put in a safe deposit account in
the bank for future investment by the client.

Since his demise, even the members of his family haven't applied for claims
over this fund and it has been in the safe deposit account until I
discovered that it cannot be claimed since our client is a foreign national
and we are sure that he has no next of kin here to file claims over the
money. As the director of the department, this discovery was brought to my
office so as to decide what is to be done. I decided to seek ways through
which to transfer this money out of the bank and out of the country too.

The total amount in the account is $18.5 millions with my positions as
staffs of the bank, I am handicapped because I cannot operate foreign
accounts and cannot lay bonafide claim over this money. The client was a
foreign national and you will only be asked to act as his next of kin and I
will supply you with all the necessary information and bank data to assist
you in being able to transfer this money to any bank of your choice where
this money could be transferred into.

The total sum will be shared as follows: 50% for me, 50% for you and
expenses incidental occur during the transfer will be incur by both of us.
The transfer is risk free on both sides hence you are going to follow my
instruction till the fund transfer to your account. Since I work in this
bank that is why you should be confident in the success of this transaction
because you will be updated with information as at when desired.

I will wish you to keep this transaction secret and confidential as I am
hoping to retire with my share of this money at the end of transaction
which will be when this money is safety in your account. I will then come
over to your country for sharing according to the previously agreed
percentages. You might even have to advise me on possibilities of
investment in your country or elsewhere of our choice. May God help you to
help me to a restive retirement, Amen,

Please for further information and inquires feel free to contact me back
immediately for more explanation and better understanding I want you to
assure me your capability of handling this project with trust by providing
me your following information details such as:

(1)NAME..............
(2)AGE:................
(3)SEX:.....................
(4)PHONE NUMBER:.................
(5)OCCUPATION:................ .....
(6)YOUR COUNTRY:.....................

Yours sincerely,

Mr.Zerbo Yameogo.
