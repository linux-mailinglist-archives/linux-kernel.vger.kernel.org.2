Right.

No. There's 2 ways to do that. The above does and adding $nodename in
dp-aux-bus.yaml will. The latter also means the schema will be applied
automatically to any node named 'aux-bus'. That means the schema will
be applied twice unless you have 'select: false'. The main advantage
of the latter case is it gets applied even without all the users
converted to schema.

Sure.
