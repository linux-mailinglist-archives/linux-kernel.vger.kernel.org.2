Not sure why but with this patch I quickly got a division-by-zero in BFQ and
complete system halt. Unfortunately I couldn't capture the exact stack trace,
but it read something like bfq_calc_weight() or something ike that.
I looked through the code and found bfq_delta(), so maybe weight got
reduced to 0?
