True, per RID or per PF as I was referring to.

True, but one process can submit work to multiple mdevs from different
RIDs/PFs. One process uses one PASID and PASID translation table is per VM.
The same PASID is used for all the PASID tables of each RID.

For example:
VM1 has two mdevs: mdev1 and mdev2. mdev1's parent is RID1, mdev2's parent
is RID2. The guest process A allocates PASID_A and bind to both mdev1 and
mdev2. PASID_A must be present in the PASID tables for both RID1 and RID2.

If the allocator is per RID, it is not possible to ensure PASID_A is
available for both RIDs. Right?

Sorry I missed this point in my earlier explanation.

That higher level in the hierarchy is global, right? I am a little
concerned about expanding PASID table sharing from security perspective.
Even though, VMs already share PASID table for mdevs.

Yes, PASID translation table is per VM, global in terms of the guest.
That combined with the case of two mdevs from different RIDs can be used by
the same guest process/PASID requires global PASID.

Intel vIOMMU has to use a generic uAPI to allocate PASID so the generic
code need to have this option. I guess you are saying we should also have a
per RID allocation option in addition to global?

Sorry, I am not following. There would not be mixed iommu drivers on one
platform, I must have missed your point. Could you explain a little?

AFAIK, the current SMMU device assignment is per RID, since only one stage2
page tables per RID, not per PASID. This is equivalent to the older VT-d
spec. prior to scalable mode.

Eric/Jean, can you help?
