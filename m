  I sent this mail praying it will found you in a good condition of
health,since I myself are in a very critical health condition in which
I sleep every night without knowing if I may be alive to see the next
day.I'm Mrs.Monika John Carlsen,wife of late Mr John Carlsen, a widow
suffering from long time illness. I have some funds I inherited from
my late husband,the sum of($11.000.000,eleven million dollars)my
Doctor told me recently that I have serious sickness  which is cancer
problem. What disturbs me most is my stroke sickness.Having known my
condition, I decided to donate this fund to a good person that will
utilize it the way i am going to instruct herein.I need a very honest
and God fearing person who can claim this money and use it for Charity
works,for orphanages,widows and also build schools for less privileges
that will be named after my late husband if possible and to promote
the word of God and the effort that the house of God is maintained.

I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly
manner. That's why I'm taking this decision. I'm not afraid of death
so I know where I'm going. I accept this decision because I do not
have any child who will inherit this money after I die. Please I want
your sincerely and urgent answer to know if you will be able to
execute this project, and I will give you more information on how the
fund will be transferred to your bank account. I am waiting for your
reply.

Best Regards,
Mrs.Monika John Carlsen
