Ingo, Thomas or Peter, is there any chance one of you could take a look
at patch "[PATCH 2/6] mm/page_alloc: Convert per-cpu list protection to
local_lock" from this series? It's partially motivated by PREEMPT_RT. More
details below.

The bulk page allocation series that the local_lock work had an
additional fix so I've rebased this onto

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mel/linux.git mm-percpu-local_lock-v1r16

It's this part I'm interested in even though it only partially addresses
the preempt-rt tree concerns. More legwork is needed for preempt-rt which
is outside the context of this series. At minimum, it involves

1. Split locking of pcp and buddy allocator instead of using spin_lock()
   when it's "known" that IRQs are disabled (not necessarily a valid
   assumption on PREEMPT_RT)
2. Split the zone lock into what protects the zone metadata and what
   protects the free lists

This looks straight-forward but it involves audit work and it may be
difficult to avoid regressing non-PREEMPT_RT kernels by disabling/enabling
IRQs when switching between the pcp allocator and the buddy allocator.
