yes, dp driver did support down grade link rate during link training 
procedure.
But link training is kind of setting up agreement between host and panel 
with assumption that there are no other limitations in between.
The problem we are discussing here is the limitation of usb re driver 
link rate support.
Since we do not know how usb re driver behavior, I am not sure link 
training will work appropriately for this case.
It may end up link status keep toggling up and down.

Both link-lane and link-rate specified at dtsi are for the limitation of 
Trogdor hardware platform.
Both link-lane and link-rate specified at dtsi are NOT for panel since 
panel have specified its capability at its DPCD.
