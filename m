Sorry, I was waiting for Stephen to reply and eventually decided to
shift focus to other things first. :)

The whole low-power topic is kind of frustrating on older platforms
because they currently still lack almost everything that is necessary to
reach those low power states. Even things that you already consider
natural for newer platforms (such as interconnect) are still very much
work in progress on all older ones.

... And therefore I think we should be careful with such changes,
especially if they would prevent devices from booting completely.
Unfortunately the users trying to make use of old platforms are also
often the ones who might not be aware that they suddenly need
"clk_ignore_unused" just to boot a system that was previously working
(mostly) fine, except for the whole low-power topic.

I fully agree with you that disabling the unused clocks here is the
right thing to do, but I think we should try to carefully flag the most
important clocks in the driver to avoid causing too many regressions.

Thanks,
Stephan
