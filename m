If there are cases where the "start bandwidth" matters, I think there is need to expose the
"start bandwidth" explicitly too. However, I doubt the existence of such cases from my view
and the two examples above.

In my thoughts, this patchset keeps cgroup usage within the quota in the longer term, and allows 
cgroup to respond to a burst of work with the help of a reasonable burst buffer. If quota is set correctly
above average usage, and enough burst buffer is set to meet the needs of bursty work. In this
case, it makes no difference whether this cgroup runs with 0 start bandwidth or all of it.
Thus I used sysctl_sched_cfs_bw_burst_onset_percent to decided the start bandwidth
to leave some convenience here. If this sysctl interface is confusing, I wonder whether it
is a good idea not to expose this interface.

For the first case mentioned above, if Kubernet users care the "start bandwidth" for process startup,
maybe it is better to give all of it rather than a part?

For the second case with quota changes over time, I think it is important making sure each change works
long enough to enforce average quota limit. Does it really matter to control "start burst" on each change?

It is an copy of runtime at period start, and used to calculate burst time during a period.
Not quite remaining_runtime_prev_period.

Thanks, cgroup v2 stats and documentation should be handled. I will add them
in the following patchset.

Yeah, there is the updating problem. It is okey not to expose cfs_b->runtime then.

This comment does not mean any loss any unnecessary throttle for present cfsb.
All this means is that all quota refilling that is not done during timer stop should be
refilled on timer start, for the burstable cfsb.

Maybe I shall change this comment in some way if it is misleading?
