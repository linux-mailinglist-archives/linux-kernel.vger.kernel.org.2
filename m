Hi all:
  I did a little test:
  git rm -r drivers/usb  --> then revert to generate patch 'usb, 553988 insertions(+)
  git rm -r mm/          --> then revert to generate patch 'mm', 157606 insertions(+)

  Two Stages(Test twice each, unit: seconds)ï¼š
  Before sorted by this patch:
  mm    264   264
  usb  1049  1047

  After sorted by this patch:
  mm    264   265
  usb  1047  1045

  According to the test results, the performance before and after sorting is basically the same.

  The test method is as follows:
  start=$(date +%s)
  scripts/checkpatch.pl --types=TYPO_SPELLING 0001-Revert-usb-remove.patch > /dev/null
  end=$(date +%s)
  seconds=$((end - start))
  echo $seconds
