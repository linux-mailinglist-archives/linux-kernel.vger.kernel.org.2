Yes, I agree that device drivers on the DFL bus should go in the 
appropriate the directory of the appropriate  framework.  As Moritz has 
pointed out there are already examples bus specific driver code, for 
multiple buses, being the driver framework directory (e.g. Designware 
I2C).

In this particular case, the Device Feature is wraps a particular 
instantiation of an Altera SPI Master controller.  As Yilun pointed out, this 
wrapper has a SPI_CORE_PARAMETER register which contains the values 
of all the configuration parameters of the Altera SPI Master IP block. 
This kind of information would also be included in a Device Tree 
description of the instantiation. The Device Feature also implements 
indirect register access to the actual registers of the Altera SPI Master 
that provides a bridge from the PCIe bus to the Avalon Slave containing 
the registers of the Altera SPI Master.

Given the Device Feature wraps an Altera SPI Master, it might still make 
sense for the DFL driver to instantiate a sub driver instance for the 
Altera SPI Master.  I will resubmit the current patches with 
drivers/fpga/dfl-spi-altera.c moved to drivers/spi/spi-altera-dfl.c for 
feedback from the SPI maintainers and continue investigating collapsing 
the DFL driver and the platform sub-driver into a single DFL driver.  My 
first attempt did not go well.
