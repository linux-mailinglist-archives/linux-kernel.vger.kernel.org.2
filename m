This change converts PDC interrupt controller bindings to yaml.

Cc: devicetree@vger.kernel.org
Signed-off-by: Maulik Shah <mkshah@codeaurora.org>
---
This change depends on [1] which adds sc7280 compatible for PDC

Changes in v2:
- Document optional PDC's GIC interface reg
- Update example to mention optional reg.

-PDC interrupt controller
-
-Qualcomm Technologies Inc. SoCs based on the RPM Hardened architecture have a
-Power Domain Controller (PDC) that is on always-on domain. In addition to
-providing power control for the power domains, the hardware also has an
-interrupt controller that can be used to help detect edge low interrupts as
-well detect interrupts when the GIC is non-operational.
-
-GIC is parent interrupt controller at the highest level. Platform interrupt
-controller PDC is next in hierarchy, followed by others. Drivers requiring
-wakeup capabilities of their device interrupts routed through the PDC, must
-specify PDC as their interrupt controller and request the PDC port associated
-with the GIC interrupt. See example below.
-
-Properties:
-
-- compatible:
-	Usage: required
-	Value type: <string>
-	Definition: Should contain "qcom,<soc>-pdc" and "qcom,pdc"
-		    - "qcom,sc7180-pdc": For SC7180
-		    - "qcom,sc7280-pdc": For SC7280
-		    - "qcom,sdm845-pdc": For SDM845
-		    - "qcom,sdm8250-pdc": For SM8250
-		    - "qcom,sdm8350-pdc": For SM8350
-
-- reg:
-	Usage: required
-	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
-	Definition: Specifies the base physical address for PDC hardware.
-
-- interrupt-cells:
-	Usage: required
-	Value type: <u32>
-	Definition: Specifies the number of cells needed to encode an interrupt
-		    source.
-		    Must be 2.
-		    The first element of the tuple is the PDC pin for the
-		    interrupt.
-		    The second element is the trigger type.
-
-- interrupt-controller:
-	Usage: required
-	Value type: <bool>
-	Definition: Identifies the node as an interrupt controller.
-
-- qcom,pdc-ranges:
-	Usage: required
-	Value type: <u32 array>
-	Definition: Specifies the PDC pin offset and the number of PDC ports.
-		    The tuples indicates the valid mapping of valid PDC ports
-		    and their hwirq mapping.
-		    The first element of the tuple is the starting PDC port.
-		    The second element is the GIC hwirq number for the PDC port.
-		    The third element is the number of interrupts in sequence.
-
-Example:
-
-	pdc: interrupt-controller@b220000 {
-		compatible = "qcom,sdm845-pdc";
-		reg = <0xb220000 0x30000>;
-		qcom,pdc-ranges = <0 512 94>, <94 641 15>, <115 662 7>;
-		#interrupt-cells = <2>;
-		interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
-		interrupt-controller;
-	};
-
-DT binding of a device that wants to use the GIC SPI 514 as a wakeup
-interrupt, must do -
-
-	wake-device {
-		interrupts-extended = <&pdc 2 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
-	};
-
-In this case interrupt 514 would be mapped to port 2 on the PDC as defined by
-the qcom,pdc-ranges property.
