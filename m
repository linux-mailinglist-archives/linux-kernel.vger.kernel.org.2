Coming to think of it, this isn't just for shared pages. We also hold
on to the swap slot as long as the page is read-only, not mlocked, and
swap isn't full. So scratch "for shared pages" here.

Correction:

When pages are swapped in, the VM may retain the swap copy to avoid
repeated writes in the future. It's also retained if shared pages are
faulted back in some processes, but not in others. During that time we
have an in-memory copy of the page, as well as an on-swap
copy. Cgroup1 and cgroup2 handle these overlapping lifetimes slightly
differently due to the nature of how they account memory and swap:

Correction:

As a result, cgroup2 currently undercounts retained swap to varying
degrees: swap slots are cached up to 50% of the configured limit or
total available swap space; partially faulted back shared pages are
only limited by physical capacity. This in turn allows cgroups to
significantly overconsume their alloted swap space.

I also think we should tag stable on this one. The potential
accounting error is quite large and, even without concrete examples,
is likely to cause problems for swap management in the real world.
