Subject: [PATCH V2 0/5] Add PMIC DT files for sc7280 
Date:   Thu,  1 Apr 2021 14:43:11 +0530
Message-Id: <1617268396-1837-1-git-send-email-skakit@codeaurora.org>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.7.4
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Changes in V2:
 - As per Matthias's comments:
    - I've Split the patch into per-PMIC patches and one sc7280 patch
    - Removed 2nd critical point, thermal-governer property
	- s/pm8325_tz/pm7325_temp_alarm and s/pm7325_temp_alarm/pm7325_thermal
    - Fixed few other minor errors.

 - As per Bjorn's comments, replaced '_' with '-' in node names and moved
   DT files inclusion to board dts.

This series is dependent on below series which adds DT files for SC7280 SoC
