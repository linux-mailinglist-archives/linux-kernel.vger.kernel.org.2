At a very high level, yes, both get user data into ftrace.
This question has been brought up a few times, if you watch the LPC2021
Tracing MC session this came up and got answered.

Markers do not get user data into perf and eBPF, nor do they allow user mode
applications to know when to emit the trace_marker (we only want to trace
and incur the syscall cost when something requests that data).

We also want to be able to use all the bells and whistles of
ftrace/perf. This means supporting field labels so things like hist,
filter and triggers work on a per-event basis (IE: Durable identifier
such as the event name).

Thanks,
