Hi, Paolo

I didn't think of this contition.

It's seems that if we want to idle when more than one group is active,
there are two additional conditions:

- all dispatched requests have the same size
- all active groups contain the same number of active queues

Thus we still need to track how many queues are active in each group.
The conditions seems to be too much, do you think is it worth it to
add support to idle when more than one group is active?

Thanks
Kuai
