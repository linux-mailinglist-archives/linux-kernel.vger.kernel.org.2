It's worth explaining the motivation for this more clearly.  Currently the only
user of blk-crypto is fscrypt (on ext4 and f2fs), which (currently) only submits
bios where the size of each segment is a multiple of data_unit_size.  That
happens to avoid most of the cases where bios could be split in the middle of a
data unit.  However, when support for direct I/O on encrypted files is added, or
when support for filesystem metadata encryption is added, it will be possible
for bios to have segment lengths that are only multiples of the logical block
size.  So the block layer needs to start handling this case appropriately.
