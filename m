I do not want anything to print to the "main buffer" that can not be
filtered or turned off by the tracing infrastructure itself (aka tracefs
file system).

Once we allow that, then the trace file will become useless because
everything will write to the main buffer and fill it with noise.

Events that can be enabled and disabled from tracefs are fine, as they can
be limited. This is why I added that nasty warning if people leave around
trace_printk(), because it does exactly this (write to the main buffer).
It's fine for debugging a custom kernel, but should never be enabled in
something that is shipped, or part of mainline.
