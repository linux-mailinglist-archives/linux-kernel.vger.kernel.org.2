1) this has been done in the past but has been reverted later.
2) any vmalloc changes will affect non-memcg allocations too.
 If we're doing memcg-related checks it's better to do it in one place.
3) it is not vmalloc-only issue. Huge number of  kmalloc page allocations 
from N concurrent threads will lead to the same problem.
