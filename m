Do you really want schedstats or do you want the tracepoints? In general
I really want to cut back on the built-in statistics crud we carry,
there's too much and it seems to keep growing forever :-(

(as is the case here, you're extending it as well)

That said; making schedstats cover the other classes can be seen as
fixing an inconsistency, but then you forgot deadline.

Yeah, this seems to give a terrible mess, let me see if I can come up
with anything less horrible.
