Sorry, for mentioning what I mean by enable state. So, the idea is the
the state that would be mentioned in the DT property would be the state
to which the mux to be set for enabling the given device and hence I am
referring to it as enable state. I feel that referring to it as state
would not convey the above.

Yes, using mux for mux_state type does seem to be misleading. I'll
change it to the mstate.
