Hi Mathieu,

Thanks for the comments.

I double checked the code. Please see my comments below.

Hi Mathieu,

Could you please share what is the advantage to handle the sources 
associated with a CPU separatly ?

 From the code, cpu id is only used to get the path of the ETM source.

As there will be many tpdm sources, I think it will be easier to only 
maintain one list for all the sources.

Agree with you. I will try to use IDR orÂ  the hash of the device name as 
a key to a hashing vector.

When source is disabled, but sink is still actived. It will be confused 
for end users.
