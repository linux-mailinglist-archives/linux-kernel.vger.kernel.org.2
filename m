Good catch!

However I don't think the current fix is valid because these engines
are meant to be used by the raw NAND core as well, I propose something
like the below, can you please tell me if it works as expected? (not
even build tested)

Thanks,

    mtd: spinand: Fix double counting of ECC stats
    
    In the raw NAND world, ECC engines increment ecc_stats and the final
    caller is responsible for returning -EBADMSG if the verification
    failed.
    
    In the SPI-NAND world it was a bit different until now because there was
    only one possible ECC engine: the on-die one. Indeed, the
    spinand_mtd_read() call was incrementing the ecc_stats counters
    depending on the outcome of spinand_check_ecc_status() directly.
    
    So now let's split the logic like this:
    - spinand_check_ecc_status() is specific to the SPI-NAND on-die engine
      and is kept very simple: it just returns the ECC status (bonus point:
      the content of this helper can be overloaded).
    - spinand_ondie_ecc_finish_io_req() is the caller of
      spinand_check_ecc_status() and will increment the counters and
      eventually return -EBADMSG.
    - spinand_mtd_read() is not tied to the on-die ECC implementation and
      should be able to handle results coming from other ECC engines: it has
      the responsibility of returning the maximum number of bitflips which
      happened during the entire operation as this is the only helper that
      is aware that several pages may be read in a row.
