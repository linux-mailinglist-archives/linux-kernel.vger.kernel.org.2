Hi Yi,

I think what Linus was suggsting was that if people wanted, they could
do something like this in their git commits:

From: 曹子德(Theodore Y Ts'o) <tytso@mit.edu>

I don't do this because my legal name is actually Theodore Yue Tak
Ts'o (where Ts'o Yue Tak is the standard romanization of my Chinese
name in Cantonese --- my parents were from Hong Kong), and even though
Cantonese is technically the first langauge I learned as a child, at
this point I'm probably more fluent in Spanish (my third language)
than Cantonese.  :-)

In any case, git and e-mail should be able to handle non-Roman
characters so if you want to insert your name in Chinese in your Git
authorship, please feel free to do so.  Or not --- it's totally up to
you.

Cheers,

					- Ted
