Uh, this looks unparseable, I lost some words. Let me write again that part:

Before you mentioned business entities refrain from upstreaming recent
hardware. You question now upstreaming not that recent hardware, so
basically business entity has no incentives to work at all with upstream
on any platform. Neither newest, nor slightly older.
