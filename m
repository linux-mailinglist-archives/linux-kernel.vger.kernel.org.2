Hi Douglas,

I think the behaviour with GCC is also similar. We were working on this change
(https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210304163255.10363-4-alexandre.truong@arm.com/)
in userspace Perf which addresses the same issue.

The basic concept of our version is to record only the link register
(as in --user-regs=lr). Then use the existing dwarf based unwind
to determine if the link register is valid for that frame, and then if
it is and it doesn't already exist on the stack then insert it.

You mention that your version isn't perfect, do you think that saving the
LR and using something like libunwind in a post process could be better?

Thanks
James
