What I really like about my 8 8 14 split I have, it makes everything 2K in
size on 64 bit machines (1K 1K 2K for 32 bit, but who cares ;-)

 1 << 8 * 8 bytes = 2K   // top tiers are pointers to lower tiers
 1 << 14 bits = 2K       // lower tier only cares about bits

This means they will likely all be allocated in the same slab.

I'm optimizing the top tiers for size, because they are likely to be empty.
Why add memory for something that will never be used, and can't be removed.
Note, the middle and lower tiers can be reused when they go empty, which is
a likely use case (at least when I test this using hackbench).

I looked into xarray and it appears to be optimized for storing something,
where as I'm just interested in a sparse bitmask.

Thanks for the review.

Note, I'll be posting a v3 soon because I found if I echo 1<<30 into
set_event_pid, it adds 0 (because it only looks at the bottom 30 bits).
It should really return -EINVAL.
