We could change that on get_tb() or mftb() @ timebase.h, which would
have a broader reach, but would not reach any mftb from asm code.

Sure, that would avoid having to get paca->tb_offset for every mftb()
called, and avoid inconsistencies when different ways to get time are
used in code.

On the other hand, it would make it very hard to debug functions like
kvmppc_guest_entry_inject_int() as I am doing right now.

So, IIUC all we can do is split this in 2 changes:
1 - Adding notrace to those functions
2 - Introducing a kernel debug config that reverts (1) and 'fixes' mftb

If that's correct, I have some ideas we can use. 

For debug option, should we add the offset on get_tb() or mftb()?

Another option would be to adding this tb_offset only in the routines
used by tracing. But this could probably mean having to add a function
in arch-generic code, but still an option.

What do you think?
