Subject: [PATCH RFC v2] mhi: Enable unique QRTR node ID support
Date:   Fri, 26 Feb 2021 16:12:48 +0530

On multi-mhi platforms, host WiFi driver and
QMI test driver needs to differntiate between
QMI packets received from multiple mhi devices.

With QCN9000 PCI cards, once SBL gets loaded, we
utilize ERRDBG2 register to write a unique value
per mhi device from device-tree that the device
utilizes to set a unique QRTR node ID and
instance ID for the QMI service. This helps QRTR
stack in differenting the packets in a multi-mhi
environment and can route them accordingly.

sample:
root@OpenWrt:/# qrtr-lookup
  Service Version Instance Node  Port
       15       1        0    8     1 Test service
       69       1        8    8     2 ATH10k WLAN firmware service
       15       1        0   24     1 Test service
       69       1       24   24     2 ATH10k WLAN firmware service

Here 8 and 24 on column 3 (QMI Instance ID)
and 4 (QRTR Node ID) are the node IDs that
is unique per mhi device.
