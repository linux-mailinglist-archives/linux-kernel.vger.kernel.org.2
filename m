I'm curious about the performance difference between this and the
map/unmap vIOMMU, as well as the coIOMMU. This is probably a lot faster
but those don't depend on IOPF which is a pretty rare feature at the
moment.

Do you think selective-faulting will be the norm, or only a problem for
initial IOPF implementations?  To me it's the selective-faulting kind of
device that will be the odd one out, but that's pure speculation. Either
way maintaining a device list seems like a pain.

By the way the current fault report API is missing a way to invalidate
partial faults: when the IOMMU device's PRI queue overflows, it may
auto-respond to page request groups that were already partially reported
by the IOMMU driver. Upon detecting an overflow, the IOMMU driver needs to
tell all fault consumers to discard their partial groups.
iopf_queue_discard_partial() [1] does this for the internal IOPF handler
but we have nothing for the lower-level fault handler at the moment. And
it gets more complicated when injecting IOPFs to guests, we'd need a
mechanism to recall partial groups all the way through kernel->userspace
and userspace->guest.

Shenming suggests [2] to also use the IOPF handler for IOPFs managed by
device drivers. It's worth considering in my opinion because we could hold
partial groups within the kernel and only report full groups to device
drivers (and guests). In addition we'd consolidate tracking of IOPFs,
since they're done both by iommu_report_device_fault() and the IOPF
handler at the moment.

Note that I plan to upstream the IOPF patch [1] as is because it was
already in good shape for 5.12, and consolidating the fault handler will
require some thinking.

Thanks,
Jean
