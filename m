IIUC, this works in situations when the limits are set in decreasing
fashion (from root down) till very (controller) leaves. That's a valid
config and you're right that following 'max' events gets you to the
misbehaving/underprovisioned cgroup.

If there's a limit on certain level with otherwise unconstrained cgroup
structure below (a valid config too), the 'fail' counter would help
determining what the affected cgroup is. Does that make sense to you?

The log messages as implemented currently, aren't as useful as proposed
'fail' counter (they would need report 'cg' path, not 'i').

I see justification for 'fail' events as a replacement for the dropped
log messages. Although it's not a complete replacement due to longer
persistence of the log, illustrated e.g. with the short-lived containers
whose cgroups/fail counts are gone).
