Thanks for your reply. I understand the reasoning on why we don't allow
kworkers to a custom cgroup.

Yeah. The workqueue attrs comes in handy to reduce the nice/prio of a
background workqueue if we identify that it is cpu intensive. However, this
needs case by case analysis, tweaking etc. If there is no other alternative,
we might end up chasing the background workers and reduce their nice value.

The problem at our hand (which you might be knowing already) is that, lets say
we have 2 cgroups in our setup and we want to prioritize UX over background.
IOW, reduce the cpu.shares of background cgroup. This helps in prioritizing
Task-A and Task-B over Task-X and Task-Y. However, each individual kworker
can potentially have CPU share equal to the entire UX cgroup.

-kworker/0:0
-kworker/1:0
- UX
----Task-A
----Task-B
- background
----Task-X
----Task-Y

Hence we want to move all kernel threads to another cgroup so that this cgroup
will have CPU share equal to UX.

The patch presented here allows us to create the above setup. Any other
alternative approaches to achieve the same without impacting any future
designs/requirements?

Thanks,
Pavan
