o_O

Reading a protected block makes the device to reboot?

What is the exact device? Can you share the datasheet? Is this behavior
expected? Because it seems really broken to me, a read should not
trigger *anything* that bad.

We do have a "lock" property which informs the host to first unlock the
device, would this help? Is this locking reversible?

It sounds like a chip specificity/bug, would it make sense to add a
specific vendor implementation for that?
