Correct. But isn't that a nature of pretty much any spinlock based
contention? There is not really much to be done except for removing the
lock. Batching helps to amortize the spinning for the actual useful work
so that the spinning is not predominant. Trylocking to reduce that
spinning can be helpful only if you _know_ that other useful work could
be done and that you do not dalay the locked work way to much. This is a
tricky balance to make.

Could you share more about requirements for those? Why is unmapping in
any of their hot paths which really require low latencies? Because as
long as unmapping requires a shared resource - like lru lock - then you
have a bottle necks.

What is the base for that 59.5%? Also how representative this is for
your sensitive workload?
