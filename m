See 266e5cf39a0f ("arm64: dts: qcom: sm8250: remove mmcx regulator") and
3652265514f5 ("clk: qcom: gdsc: enable optional power domain support")

MMCX is declared as power-domain for the dispcc (which is correct
in itself) and the gdsc code will register GDSCs as subdomains of
the same power-domain.


To ensure this code path is invoked the clock driver itself needed this
6158b94ec807 ("clk: qcom: dispcc-sm8250: use runtime PM for the clock
controller")

So at least in theory, considering only USB the minimum would be to
pm_runtime_enable() gcc-7280 and add power-domains = <CX> to the gcc
node.


The "problem" I described would be if there are GDSCs that are
subdomains of MX - which I've seen hinted in some documentation. If so
we should to specify both CX and MX as power-domains for &gcc and the
gdsc implementation needs to be extended to allow us to select between
the two.

For this I believe a combination of genpd_dev_pm_attach_by_name() and
of_genpd_add_subdomain() would do the trick.

That is, if there actually are GDSCs exposed by gcc that are not
subdomains of CX - otherwise none of this is needed.
