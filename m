I did not have sc7180 with edp before so that i am not sure it will 
happen on sc7180 or not.
The usb3 does not work when both edp and dp enabled I just seen at 
sc7280.
Current at sc7280 EC is not boot up correctly when system power up.
I have to manual reboot EC from linux kernel shell before DP/usb3 can 
work.
I am not sure this contribute to this problem or not.
