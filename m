Thanks Rasmus!

@Marc: Looks like we can not get around the __packed() fix :-(

At least we now have some more documentation to be referenced and I 
would suggest to point out that some compilers handle the union 
alignment like this.

To make clear in the comments what we are suppressing here any why.

Many thanks,
Oliver
