Hi,

Yeah there is a 'parallel' thread about adding the tracing ring buffer as a 'back end' to the dynamic debug stuff over here:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20211105192637.2370737-9-jim.cromie@gmail.com/

The attempt there is more generic but I realize now that it is adding the tracing to an 'instance' which is specific to dynamic debug which is being
created via: trace_array_get_by_name(). I would prefer to just have it print to the 'main' trace buffer such that it's easier to read, although I
guess they could still be consolidated via timestamps. Hmmm...I think there was a previous proposal to just add a single tracepoint (that takes a
string) to the dynamic debug layer that could be called if a dynamic debug site is enabled for trace buffer output. Would that satisfy the ftrace
level filtering requirements that you are looking for?

Thanks,

-Jason
