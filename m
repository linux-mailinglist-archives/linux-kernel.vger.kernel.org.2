Having the same driver for all this sounds good, thanks for clarifying!

The node name (sram@...) is fine. I was actually referring to the
"compatible". Given what you have written above there is more in that
region than just "qcom,rpm-*sleep*-stats". There are also logs and other
stats there. Perhaps "qcom,rpm(h)-stats" (without -sleep-) would already
be more clear.

Or, my other suggestion was to not make any assumption about particular
contents of the data RAM in the device tree. The compatible could also
be called simply "qcom,rpm-data-ram" (just like "qcom,rpm-msg-ram") and
the assumption what it contains (e.g. sleep stats) could be made in your
existing driver.

This is probably a matter of preference at the end and won't make a big
difference but I just wanted to mention it.

For example, to make your driver work on MSM8916 I had to declare a much
larger memory region (e.g. 0x10000 vs 0x400):

		sram@290000 {
			compatible = "qcom,rpm-sleep-stats";
			reg = <0x00290000 0x10000>;
		};

This is because RPM_DYNAMIC_ADDR contains the offset 0xdba0 instead of
e.g. 0x020c on newer SoCs and the memory region must be large enough to
cover the offset.

It just feels a bit weird for me to describe such a large region as only
containing "qcom,rpm-*sleep*-stats". "qcom,rpm-data-ram" might better
describe it what it really is and then your driver can decide what to do
with it.

But, as I said, this is just naming which is always subjective. :)

Thanks!
Stephan
