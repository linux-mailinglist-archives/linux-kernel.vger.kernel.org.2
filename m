I think this is the wrong way to go.

I sent a patch for android lowmemorykiller some years ago.

http://driverdev.linuxdriverproject.org/pipermail/driverdev-devel/2017-February/100319.html

It has been improved since than, so it can act handle oom callbacks, it can act on vmpressure and psi
and as a shrinker. The patches has not been ported to resent kernels though.

I don't think vmpressure and psi is that relevant now. (They are what userspace act on)  But the basic idea is to have a priority queue
within the kernel. It need pick up new processes and dying process.  And then it has a order, and that
is set with oom adj values by activity manager in android.  I see this model can be reused for
something that is between a standard oom and userspace.  Instead of vmpressure and psi
a watchdog might be a better way.  If userspace (in android the activity manager or lmkd) does not kick the watchdog,
the watchdog bite the task according to the priority and kills it.  This priority list does not have to be a list generated 
within kernel. But it has the advantage that you inherent parents properties.  We use a rb-tree for that.

All that is missing is the watchdog.
