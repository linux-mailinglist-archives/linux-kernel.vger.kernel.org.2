This is supposed to be prohibited by the fact that rcutree.use_softirq
prevents the rcuc kthreads from being spawned in the first place.

That said, I do not recall having thought through the de-offloading
process with the rcuc kthreads in mind.  There could easily be bugs
in this case.  (I -think- that it is OK because each rcuc kthread is
confined to running on the corresponding CPU and because it disables BH.
But it is the system's opinion that counts.)

They are independent, though by default RT arranges for rcuc kthreads and
CONFIG_RCU_BOOST.  Now there are kthreads created for CONFIG_RCU_BOOST,
but these are the rcub kthreads, and they are not per CPU, but rather
per leaf rcu_node structure.
