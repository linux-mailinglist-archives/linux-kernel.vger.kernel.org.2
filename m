Note that the current cpuset partition implementation have implemented 
some restrictions on when a partition can be enabled. However, I missed 
some corner cases in the original implementation that allow certain 
cpuset operations to make a partition invalid. I tried to plug those 
holes in this patchset. However, if maintaining backward compatibility 
is more important, I can leave those holes and update the documentation 
to make sure that people check cpuset.partition.type to confirm if their 
operation succeeds.

Cheers,
Longman
