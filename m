The fundamental reason why those kthreads are in the root cgroup is because
they're doing work on behalf of the entire system and their resource usages
can't be attributed to any specific cgroup. What we want to do is accounting
actual usages to the originating cgroups so that cpu cycles spent by kswapd
is charged to the originating cgroups, however well we can define them, and
then throttle the origin if the consumption is going over budget for that
cgroup's allocation. This is how we already handle shared IOs.

The problem with the proposed patch is that it breaks the logical
organization of resource hierarchy in a way which hinders proper future
solutions.

If all you want is deprioritizing certain kworkers, please use workqueue
attrs instead.

Thanks.
