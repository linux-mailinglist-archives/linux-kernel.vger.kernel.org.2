So far, there are no self-describing images that cause a
change in run-time behavior, and I don't think that will
happen for the very reason that the class-driver would
need to know about it.

When I asserted that not all self-describing images are
changing firmware, I did not mean to imply that they change
run-time behavior; they do not. They are part of a multi-
step update of firmware. However, looking at each part of
the sequence independently, there is at least one instance
where a certificate is stored in RAM for temporary use.
When the driver exits from this call, there is no firmware
change. There is also no change in run-time behavior.

I'm thinking we could have different IOCTLs:

(1) firmware  update (address, size, purpose provided
    with the image)
(2) image upload (self-describing files)
(3) image validation

These would all use most of the same code, but the FPGA
Manager flags and structure fields would be set differently.
