I can answer this

I set it up this way to unload and reload the module for each test because at
the time the module was in really bad shape and doing these reset to known state
would make it easier to find easily reproducible faults from running
test xyz than chasing
shadows when previous test abc or def had left residuals that caused an oops.

I.e. Find oopses and failures that are contained in a single test.

It should be possible to skip the unload/reload cycle for each test
now as the module
is a lot more stable.
