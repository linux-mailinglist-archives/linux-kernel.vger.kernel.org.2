I was just trying to say that via dynamic debug one could enable all debugs in a kernel source directory as in your example below via:
# echo "file drivers/soc/qcom/* +p" > /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control

So if we are just looking for a printk here, one could just use pr_debug(). Or if we want that print to go the tracing ring buffer we have been
discussing how to add that as a 'backend' for dynamic debug as well.

If we want to use tracepionts, then yeah I think it's going to require adding the file, line, module data to each tracepoint site. I think this is
probably done via the tracing macros and then that could be filtered on, but yes that's going to add bloat.

The proposal here seems to be a mix of things - use the file control that dynamic debug already has to match on file name and then enable a tracepoint
that is behind it. That seems overly complex?

Thanks,
