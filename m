Hello, we are using a Bare-metal Cloud server 
(https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/High-density-Multi-tenant-Bare-metal-Cloud-Zhang-Zheng/ab1b5f0743816c8cb7188019d844ff3f7d565d9f/figure/3), 
so there is no error log in dmesg or smartctl, and we have to check it 
in Bm-hypervisor. We finally found that the io processing process on 
Bm-hypervisor is indeed abnormal.

Thanks you.
We generally separate the physical disks. One system disk and several 
business disks. The linux kernel runs on this system disk, and various 
services run on several business disks. In this way, even if a business 
disk has a problem , it will not affect the entire system.


But the current implementation of mblloc may cause 100% of the cpu to be 
occupied for a long time, could we optimize it slightly, as follows:
