If you use data=writeback, data writes and journal writes are not 
synchronized. So, it may be possible that a journal write made it through, 
a data write didn't - the end result would be a file containing random 
contents that was on the disk.

Changheun - do you use data=writeback? Did the corruption happen only in 
newly created files? Or did it corrupt existing files?
