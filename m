Quite apart from helping with the stat you want, what you've ended
up with here is a nice cleanup in several different ways (and I'm
glad Johannes talked you out of __GFP_NOFAIL: much better like this).
I'll say

Acked-by: Hugh Dickins <hughd@google.com>

but I am quite unhappy with the name mem_cgroup_finish_swapin_page():
it doesn't finish the swapin, it doesn't finish the page, and I'm
not persuaded by your paragraph above that there's any "transaction"
here (if there were, I'd suggest "commit" instead of "finish"'; and
I'd get worried by the css_put before it's called - but no, that's
fine, it's independent).

How about complementing mem_cgroup_charge_swapin_page() with
mem_cgroup_uncharge_swapin_swap()?  I think that describes well
what it does, at least in the do_memsw_account() case, and I hope
we can overlook that it does nothing at all in the other case.

And it really doesn't need a page argument: both places it's called
have just allocated an order-0 page, there's no chance of a THP here;
but you might have some idea of future expansion, or matching
put_swap_page() - I won't object if you prefer to pass in the page.

But more interesting, though off-topic, comments on it below...

I understand why you put that !mem_cgroup_disabled() check in there,
but I have a series of observations on that.

First I was going to say that it would be better left to
mem_cgroup_uncharge_swap() itself.

Then I was going to say that I think it's already covered here
by the cgroup_memory_noswap check inside do_memsw_account().

Then, going back to mem_cgroup_uncharge_swap(), I realized that 5.8's
2d1c498072de ("mm: memcontrol: make swap tracking an integral part of
memory control") removed the do_swap_account or cgroup_memory_noswap
checks from mem_cgroup_uncharge_swap() and swap_cgroup_swapon() and
swap_cgroup_swapoff() - so since then we have been allocating totally
unnecessary swap_cgroup arrays when mem_cgroup_disabled() (and
mem_cgroup_uncharge_swap() has worked by reading the zalloced array).

I think, or am I confused? If I'm right on that, one of us ought to
send another patch putting back, either cgroup_memory_noswap checks
or mem_cgroup_disabled() checks in those three places - I suspect the
static key mem_cgroup_disabled() is preferable, but I'm getting dozy.

Whatever we do with that - and it's really not any business for this
patch - I think you can drop the mem_cgroup_disabled() check from
mem_cgroup_uncharge_swapin_swap().
