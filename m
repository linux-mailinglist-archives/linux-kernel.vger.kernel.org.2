As Stephan indicated, I feel that I'll set precedence when I change
"memory" -> "smem" in the last patch.

But I can't both not paint the node and resolve the fact that the dts is
wrong. So which one should I go with?

Should we leave the node name as is until we've decided what to do with
the reserved-memory children? Or should I start accepting patches that
changes "memory" to a list of non-generic names?

I know that "memory" is wrong, but I'm not sure about what you're asking
me to do.
