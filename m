Hello my dear,

  I am glad to know you, but God knows you better and he knows why he
has directed me to you at this point in time so do not be surprised at
all. My name are Mrs.Fowler Jackie.i'm a widow, i have been suffering
from ovarian cancer disease. At this moment i am about to end the race
like this because the illness has gotten to a very bad stage, without
a child of my own. I hope that you will not expose or betray this
trust and confidence that I am about to entrust to you for the mutual
benefit of the orphans and the less privileged ones. I have some funds
I inherited from my late husband,the sum of ($12,500,000.000,
dollars.) deposited in the Bank. Having known my present health
status, I decided to entrust this fund to you believing that you will
utilize it the way i am going to instruct herein.
 Therefore I need you to assist me and reclaim this money and use it
for Charity works, for orphanages and giving justice and help to the
poor, needy and to promote the words of God and the effort that the
house of God will be maintained says The Lord." Jeremiah 22:15-16."
It will be my great pleasure to compensate you with 35 % percent of
the total money for your personal use, 5 % percent for any expenses
that may occur during the international transfer process while 60% of
the money will go to the charity project.

All I require from you is sincerity and the ability to complete God's
task without any failure. It will be my pleasure to see that the bank
has finally released and transferred the fund into your bank account
therein your country even before I die here in the hospital, because
of my present health status everything needs to be processed rapidly
as soon as possible. Please I am waiting for your immediate reply on
my private email (jackiefowler597@gmail.com) for further details of
the transaction and execution of this charitable project.
God bless you and your family.
Best Regard's.
Mrs.Fowler Jackie.
Written from the hospital.
