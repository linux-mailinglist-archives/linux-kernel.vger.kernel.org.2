That's a good point.

All aboard the mm-page_alloc-fix-stuff.patch!

No, I think it's fine to sqash them and treat it as a supplement to
Matthew's original patch (although technically it didn't make the
memcg leak any worse).

Sounds good. It depends on split_page_memcg(), but that patch is
straight-forward enough to backport as well.

Subject: [PATCH] mm: page_alloc: fix allocation imbalances from speculative
 cache lookup

When the freeing of a higher-order page block (non-compound) races
with a speculative page cache lookup, __free_pages() needs to leave
the first order-0 page in the chunk to the lookup but free the buddy
pages that the lookup doesn't know about separately.

There are currently two problems with it:

1. It checks PageHead() to see whether we're dealing with a compound
   page after put_page_testzero(). But the speculative lookup could
   have freed the page after our put and cleared PageHead, in which
   case we would double free the tail pages.

   To fix this, test PageHead before the put and cache the result for
   afterwards.

2. If such a higher-order page is charged to a memcg (e.g. !vmap
   kernel stack)), only the first page of the block has page->memcg
   set. That means we'll uncharge only one order-0 page from the
   entire block, and leak the remainder.

   To fix this, add a split_page_memcg() before it starts freeing tail
   pages, to ensure they all have page->memcg set up.

While at it, also update the comments a bit to clarify what exactly is
happening to the page during that race.
