It's for KernelCI testing, I explained the background in my other 
reply.

The only other place is the printk buffer via dev_err() and only 
the result subset of -EPROBE_DEFER info is exported via debugfs.

An additional problem with this new interface implementation is 
that it is based on the new-ish driver core "dev_err_probe" helper 
to which not all drivers have been converted (yet...), so there 
will be a mismatch between printk and this new interface.

Yes, that is correct, this is esentially duplicating information 
already exposed via the printk buffer.

I know driver core probe error message formats are unlikely to 
change over time and debugfs in theory is as "stable" as printk, 
but I think the main concern is to find a a more reliable way than 
parsing printk to extract probe erros, like for the existing 
devices_deferred in debugfs.

The idea in my specific case is to be able to reliably run driver 
tests in KernelCI for expected or unexpected probe errors like 
-EINVAL.
