Sure, it makes sense. But I still think that it won't be easy to
follow where the macro is expanded and where it is not expanded.
It might make things comlicated when people debug printk or try
to understand it's code.

BTW: Is the trick with int (printk)(const char *s, ...) documented
somewhere? Is it portable?

Honestly, I was not aware of this behavior. I did some googling.
It looks like something specific for the gcc implementation,
see the section "Looking for a function-like macroâ€™s opening
parenthesis" at
https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cppinternals/Macro-Expansion.html

This is great point! There are many other subsystem specific wrappers,
e,g, ata_dev_printk(), netdev_printk(), snd_printk(), dprintk().
We should make it easy to index them as well.

Makes sense. I would do this way.
