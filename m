Hi Mark,

Sorry for the delay in my response.

Sure, I can split this into two patches for easier review.

The POLARITY_HI and POLARITY_LO registers were described very briefly in
the cover letter. If an interrupt is already configured as either edge-
or level-triggered, setting the corresponding bit for it in the
POLARITY_HI register further configures it as rising-edge or level-high
triggered (as the case may be), while setting the same bit in
POLARITY_LO further configures it as falling-edge or level-low
triggered. I could certainly add this information to the commit message
as well.

Sorry but isn't this essentially the same as what the framework already knows as
the "sub-irq" concept, with the key difference that the register stride
is not fixed? Everything else is the same (except for a couple of minor
points noted below) - a main IRQ register that indicates sub-irq blocks
that have unhandled interrupts, as well as interrupt handling and
servicing.

The two minor differences are:
  - type_buf handling in regmap_irq_set_type() for IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH and
    IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW
  - Two extra registers: POLARITY_HI and POLARITY_LO

Well, using irq_reg_stride already does exactly this - calculating the
right register to access at every use point, as an offset from the _base
register (status, ack, type, et c.). Peripheral offsets would just be
another way of calculating the right register, that's all. And we could
have a macro as well.

Sure, I can look into how this approach would look like, but given that
the QCOM register arrangement of main vs sub-irq is essentially the same
as what the framework currently understands, couldn't we simply have a
macro to change the way the right register offset is calculated
(irq_reg_stride vs. peripheral offsets)?

Also, could you elaborate more on the genirq route? I'm not sure where
to start looking to evaluate one route vs the other.

Thank you.

Guru Das.
