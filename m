Hah, yeah, this is a non-starter.

Enrico, what real problem are you trying to solve by doing this?  And
have you tried anything with this yet?  We almost never talk about
"proposals" without seeing real code as it's pointless to discuss things
when you haven't even proven that it can work.

So let's see code before even talking about this...

And as Christian points out, you can do this today without any kernel
changes, so to think you need to modify the kernel means that you
haven't even tried this at all?
