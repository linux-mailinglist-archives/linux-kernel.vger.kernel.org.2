This patch seems like a band-aid for an issue that isn't fully
understood. I suppose it's good that the irq will stay asserted forever
and then it won't happen again until it gets cleared by some other
processor in the SoC. Instead of the WARN_ONCE() can we track if any irq
is handled when the chained irq is raised, and if nothing is handled
then call handle_bad_irq() on the chained descriptor? Take a look at
pinctrl-msm.c to see how they handled spurious irqs that aren't actually
directed at the APPS processor. We should do something similar here.
