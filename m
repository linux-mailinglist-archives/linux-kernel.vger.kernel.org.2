No, this is not correct, was explained several times and it is one of
the reasons why I am holding back to reuse of existing driver. You
copied few 32-bit ARM (ARMv7) solutions from old MCT driver into a new
one which is only 64-bit. These 32-bit solutions are some optimizations
or hacks matching 32-bit ARM Exynos processors. If you copy them to
entirely new driver for entirely different IP block, it means this is
not entirely different IP block.

Therefore I see a point now in having a Exynos MCTv2 driver for new IP
blocks after removing all that legacy 32-bit ARM stuff.

Therefore:
> evt->rating = 350;
Not 500. Use the same value as old timer driver for ARMv8. See previous
discussions and commits from Marek and Will.

Other:
> static u32 exynos_read_count_32(void)

This is u64, not u32. Get rid of 32-bit optimization/hack or explain it
similarly as Doug did (40 lines of reasoning).

>  .mask           = CLOCKSOURCE_MASK(32),

Mask is 64.

These are the 32-bit legacies I found now (maybe there are more...).
Don't copy them if this is a new driver getting rid of legacy.

Yes, I see some differences in HW control which we also solve in several
other cases through structure ops. Indeed here it looks like the number
of differences in control is bigger than in other cases.

If Daniel is okay in having two drivers and you get rid of all 32-bit
legacy (including ordering against architected timers), I am fine with it.
