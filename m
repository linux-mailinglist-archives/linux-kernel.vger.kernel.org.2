Not just the next boot, but also for the current boot via /dev/dcc_sram,
more below.

Using pstore is definitely a good suggestion, we have been thinking of
adding it as a separate change once the basic support for DCC gets in.
But pstore ram backend again depends on warm reboot which is present 
only
in chrome compute platforms but android platforms do not officially 
support
warm reboot. Pstore with block devices as a backend would be ideal but 
it
is still a work in progress to use mmc as the backend [1].

Now the other reason as to why we need this dev interface in addition to
pstore,

  * Pstore contents are retrieved on the next boot, but DCC SRAM contents
    can be collected via dev interface for the current boot via SW 
trigger.
    Lets say we have some non-fatal errors in one of the subsystems and 
we
    want to analyze the register values, it becomes as simple as 
configuring
    that region, trigger dcc and collect the sram contents and parse it.

    echo "addr" > /sys/bus/platform/devices/***.dcc/config
    echo  1 > /sys/bus/platform/devices/***.dcc/trigger
    cat /dev/dcc_sram > dcc_sram.bin
    python dcc_parser.py -s dcc_sram.bin --v2 -o output/

We don't have to reboot at all for SW triggers. This is very useful and
widely used internally.

Is the custom /dev/dcc_sram not recommended because of the dependency on
the userspace component being not available openly? If so, we already 
have
the dcc parser upstream which we use to extract the sram contents [2].
