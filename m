Input from developers is very important for not only compilers and tools
but also allowing bug-explorers to understand what is happening.
ext4 currently has

  possible deadlock in start_this_handle (2)
  https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?id=38c060d5757cbc13fdffd46e80557c645fbe79ba

which even maintainers cannot understand what is happening.
How can bug-explorers know implicit logic which maintainers believe safe and correct?
It is possible that some oversight in implicit logic is the cause of
"possible deadlock in start_this_handle (2)".
Making implicit assumptions clear helps understanding.

Will "KCSAN: data-race in start_this_handle / start_this_handle" be addressed by marking?
syzbot is already waiting for
"KCSAN: data-race in jbd2_journal_dirty_metadata / jbd2_journal_dirty_metadata" at
https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?id=5eb10023f53097f003e72c6a7c1a6f14b7c22929 .

and 3) bug-explorers can understand what the developers are assuming/missing.
