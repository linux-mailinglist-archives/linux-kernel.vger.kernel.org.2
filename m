Since you've immediately misunderstood my naming, yeah, that wouldn't be
the best thing to use as a compatible.

Doesn't look like a bad idea, but if we want to *enforce* writing also
the platform-specific compatible, I can see patch series going back
and forth and getting refused because this will not be really understood
by everyone, I think.
In this case, if writing the platform compatible is something mandatory,
the only way to really make sure to avoid losing time with reviews like
"[...] here you have to write also the platform compatible", is to just
keep the thing as it is.

Starting from the fact that I don't clearly remember what-when-why of
my research done more than one year ago, I do remember that conclusion
was that, in this regard, SDM630/660 were "mostly the same" as MSM8998.
In any case, this is something that, at this point, is better get
verified, maybe.
