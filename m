Hello My Dear,

   It is with deep consideration that I am writing this letter of
proposal to you, I know that this message may be a very big surprise
to you,  Please do not feel disturbed for contacting  you in this
regards. I sent this mail praying it will found you in a good
condition of health, since I myself are in a very critical health
condition in which I  sleep every night without knowing if I may be
alive to see the next day. I am Mrs. Francisca  Carlsen from Denmark
wife of late Mr John Carlsen, a widow suffering from long time
illness. I have some funds I inherited from my late husband, the sum
of (eleven million dollars) my Doctor told me recently that I have
serious sickness which is cancer problem. What disturbs me most is my
stroke sickness.

 Having known my condition, I decided to donate this fund to a good
person that will utilize it the way i am going to instruct herein. I
need a very honest and God fearing person who can claim this money and
use it for Charity works, for orphanages, widows and also build
schools for less privileges that will be named after my late husband
if possible and to promote the word of God and the effort that the
house of God is maintained.

I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly
manner. That's why I'm taking this decision. I'm not afraid of death,
so I know where I'm going. I accept this decision because I do not
have any child who will inherit this money after I die. Please I want
your sincerely and urgent answer to know if you will be able to
execute this project, and I will give you more information on how the
fund will be transferred to your bank account. I am waiting for your
reply.


May God bless you and your family.

Best Regards,
Mrs. Francisca John  Carlsen.
