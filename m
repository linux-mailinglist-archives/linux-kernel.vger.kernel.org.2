Yeah, I like the idea of not having an fd per event. I want to make
sure the complexity is worth it. Is the overhead of an FD per event in
user space too much? What happens to the first 4 bytes (ID)? Does it not
show up in the buffer? This would be fine as long as the rel_loc idea
gets into ftrace, etc.

This would require a global array as well as a local per-FD array. I'm
wondering if the per-FD array becoming large mitigates the gain by
simply having an FD per-event.

Got it, makes sense and would eliminate the need for the IOCTL for
offsets. I like it.
