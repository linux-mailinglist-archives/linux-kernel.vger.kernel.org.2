Thank you for pointing this out. I did forget to think about this case.
However, as you mentioned the phy layer does indeed only call the
can_transceiver_phy_power_off only if can_transceiver_phy_power_on was
called earlier and this is being done using power_count,

int phy_power_off(struct phy *phy)
{
        int ret;

        if (!phy)
                return 0;

        mutex_lock(&phy->mutex);
        if (phy->power_count == 1 && phy->ops->power_off) {
                ret =  phy->ops->power_off(phy);
                if (ret < 0) {
                        dev_err(&phy->dev, "phy poweroff failed -->
%d\n", ret);
                        mutex_unlock(&phy->mutex);
                        return ret;
                }
        }
        --phy->power_count;
        mutex_unlock(&phy->mutex);
        phy_pm_runtime_put(phy);

        if (phy->pwr)
                regulator_disable(phy->pwr);

        return 0;
}

Thanks,
Aswath
