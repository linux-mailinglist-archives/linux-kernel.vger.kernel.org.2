Right.  The sPAPR TCE backend is kind of an unfortunate accident of
history.  We absolutely could do a common interface, but no-one's had
time to work on it.

Hm.  I don't think it's really like PASID.  Just like Type1, the TCE
backend represents a single DMA address space which all devices in the
container will see at all times.  The difference is that there can be
multiple (well, 2) "windows" of valid IOVAs within that address space.
Each window can have a different TCE (page table) layout.  For kernel
drivers, a smallish translated window at IOVA 0 is used for 32-bit
devices, and a large direct mapped (no page table) window is created
at a high IOVA for better performance with 64-bit DMA capable devices.

With the VFIO backend we create (but don't populate) a similar
smallish 32-bit window, userspace can create its own secondary window
if it likes, though obvious for userspace use there will always be a
page table.  Userspace can choose the total size (but not address),
page size and to an extent the page table format of the created
window.  Note that the TCE page table format is *not* the same as the
POWER CPU core's page table format.  Userspace can also remove the
default small window and create its own.

The second wrinkle is pre-registration.  That lets userspace register
certain userspace VA ranges (*not* IOVA ranges) as being the only ones
allowed to be mapped into the IOMMU.  This is a performance
optimization, because on pre-registration we also pre-account memory
that will be effectively locked by DMA mappings, rather than doing it
at DMA map and unmap time.

This came about because POWER guests always contain a vIOMMU.  That
(combined with the smallish default IOVA window) means that DMA maps
and unmaps can become an important bottleneck, rather than being
basically a small once-off cost when qemu maps all of guest memory
into the IOMMU.  That's optimized with a special interlink between
KVM and VFIO that accelerates the guest-initiated maps/unmap
operations.  However, it's not feasible to do the accounting in that
fast path, hence the need for the pre-registration.

I like the idea of a common DMA/IOMMU handling system across
platforms.  However in order to be efficiently usable for POWER it
will need to include multiple windows, allowing the user to change
those windows and something like pre-registration to amortize
accounting costs for heavy vIOMMU load.

Well... possibly we can do without the pre-reg now that 32-bit DMA
limited devics are less common, as are POWER8 systems.  With modern
devices and modern kernels a guest is likely to use a single large
64-bit secondary window mapping all guest RAM, so the vIOMMU
bottleneck shouldn't be such an issue.
