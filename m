Hi, this is your Linux kernel regression tracker speaking. To make this
easy and quick to read for everyone I for once rely on top-posting:

Bluetooth maintainers, what's the status here? The proposed patch is
fixing a regression. It's not a recent one (it afaics was introduced in
v5.11-rc1). Nevertheless it would be good to get this finally resolved.
But this thread seems inactive for more than a week now. Or was progress
made, but is only visible somewhere else?

Ciao, Thorsten (carrying his Linux kernel regression tracker hat)

P.S.: As a Linux kernel regression tracker I'm getting a lot of reports
on my table. I can only look briefly into most of them. Therefore I
unfortunately will get things wrong or miss something important. I hope
that's not the case here; if you think it is, don't hesitate to tell me
about it in a public reply. That's in everyone's interest, as what I
wrote above might be misleading to everyone reading this, which is
something I'd like to avoid.

BTW, I have no personal interest in this issue, which is tracked using
regzbot, my Linux kernel regression tracking bot
(https://linux-regtracking.leemhuis.info/regzbot/). I'm only posting
this mail to hopefully get things rolling again and hence don't need to
be CC on all further activities wrt to this regression. Also feel free
to ignore the following lines, they are meant for regzbot:

#regzbot poke
