Hi Yassine, thanks for the patch! I was doing some experiments with a
dragonboard 820-based board, and without your patch, a CPU benchmark can
quickly cause overheating - throttling mechanism doesn't start and we
get a FW reset to a bad state (likely a HW protection mechanism).

I noticed that a similar patch including cooling maps is present in
Linaro's qcom tree [0], and it was submitted upstream [1], but there was
a re-submission [2] by Konrad that was merged and dropped the thermals
part. Based on some threads I read, it seems a FW lockup was detected
with the complete patch?

I'm not sure, so I'm looping Konrad / Loic / Bjorn here, to understand
better what made this portion of the patch to be dropped.
Anyway, I think worth to mention this in your commit message Yassine,
including perhaps a fixes tag like:

Fixes: 90173a954a22 ("arm64: dts: qcom: msm8996: Add CPU opps").

Also, I'm not sure why there was no response here or why it wasn't
merged, but if it helps, please have my:

Thanks,


Guilherme
