Hi Bjorn,
Yes, we came across this patch series but this driver (leds-qcom-lpg) is a
combo one which provides support only for RGB LEDs (or TRI_LED module) along
with PWM/LPG channels allocated for it. Say, if we've additional PWM channels
on the same PMIC (that provides user-interface support) or another PMIC
(non user-interface) that has multiple PWM channels that are not used for LED
notifications, it would be good to have a separate PWM driver to support such
channels IMHO. There are couple of use cases we've come across recently.

1. Using a PWM channel for controlling external LCD backlight controller
2. Using a PWM channel for controlling a haptics actuator

Thanks,
Subbaraman
