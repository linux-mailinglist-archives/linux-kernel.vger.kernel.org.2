It still doesn't seem user friendly. Maybe it's obvious to you, but I 
suspect we left behind most of even the sophisticated perf users here.

If it's within 2-3x I guess it would be ok. For any larger data files we 
should parallelize anyways, and that works fine with the --time x/y 
method (although it usually also needs some custom scripting, perhaps 
need to figure out how to make it more user friendly)

Yes that's great and useful, but I would prefer to not maintain custom 
plugins for it. Often when I write a script it has to run in all kinds 
of weird environments that some random person installed, and it's not 
clear how portable building C will be there. And I doubt I can just copy 
the .so files around.

BTW I'm not arguing to not do the plugin (I can imagine extreme cases 
where such a plugin is the best option), but really for most of these 
things there should be easier and more portable alternatives, even if 
they are slightly slower.
