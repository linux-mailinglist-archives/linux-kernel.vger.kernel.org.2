It will look ugly. Why we define a table that may or may not be used?
Sounds fishy.

On top of that why you should tell linker to waste resources on something
that you may well know beforehand will be thrown away?

Which is good intention and thanks for doing this!

Exactly my point, but fixing one driver of zillions does not solve the issue
in general.

Some actually cares.

Then I would imagine that you already using as less kernel configuration as
possible and have as many modules as you want for the hardware that might
appear to be connected to that board, right? Then again one driver with 100+
bytes doesn't affect really your case. Disabling, for example PRINTK, will
win much more for you.
