What I meant is that you knew there would be a bisection problem
if you had not delayed this patch.

There are around ten boards including this file, and most (maybe all)
of them are not newly added machines, so there is a good chance
that there are existing users. You are right that you took care that
the combination of an old dtb with a new kernel would not be any
worse than before, and that is good. What is however missing is
the consideration of the reverse: If anyone wants to dual-boot between
old and new kernels, they are stuck with the old dtb and is missing
the bugfix along with any additional changes that may get added
in the future.

The same is true if there are any non-Linux operating systems running
on these. For instance, FreeBSD runs on Peach Pit, and if they
were using the old dtb from Linux (I have not checked if they
were compatible before this change), then booting with the latest
dtb from Linux will require the same changes to their driver to avoid
a regression.

I can live with an explanation of "we've looked at all the alternatives
and decided to break old kernels with new dtbs in this particular
case because ...", but I don't like the idea of silently changing dts
in a way that breaks using them with anything but the latest kernel
and arguing that it's not even worth debating.
