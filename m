Well, sure, the only operation you do on the group itself is attach it
to the container (and then every container operation can be thought of
as applying to all its attached groups).  But that attach operation
really is fundamentally about the group.  It always, unavoidably,
fundamentally affects every device in the group - including devices
you may not typically think about, like bridges and switches.

That is *not* true of the other device operations, like poking IO.

And in practice I suspect it will just break if you give it a >1

I suppose.  Rare enough that I expect everyone will ignore it, alas :/.

You don't get to choose that.  You could explicitly limit other things
to only one-device groups, but that would be an explicit limitation.
Essentially any device can end up in a multi-device group, if you put
it behind a PCIe to PCI bridge, or a PCIe switch which doesn't support
access controls.

The groups are still there, whether or not other things want to deal
with them.

I don't know enough about PASID to make sense of that.

Again, I don't know enough about VDPA to make sense of that.  Are we
essentially talking non-PCI virtual devices here?  In which case you
could define the VDPA "bus" to always have one-device groups.

I don't think simplified-but-wrong is a good goal.  The thing about
groups is that if they're there, you can't just "not care" about them,
they affect you whether you like it or not.
