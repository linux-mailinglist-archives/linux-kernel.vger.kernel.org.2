Sure, we just added the memory devfreq throttling as a cooling device to
Nexus 7 and Ouya DTs in addition to the CPU throttling.

The GPU and other h/w units are on the pending list. For the starter we
need to add GENPD and runtime PM support to all drivers, which solves
the overheating problem of idling systems. We have Tegra30 Ouya game
console that is getting hot during idle without the runtime PM support.
Afterwards we can add the devfreq support to improve the active cooling.
I'm already working on it.

The DTPM is a very interesting approach. For now Tegra still misses some
basics in mainline kernel which have a higher priority, so I think it
should be good enough to perform the in-kernel thermal management for
the starter. We may consider a more complex solutions later on if will
be necessary.

What I'm currently thinking to do is:

1. Set up the trips of SoC/CPU core thermal zones in accordance to the
silicon limits.

2. Set up the skin trips in accordance to the device limits.

The breached skin trips will cause a mild throttling, while the SoC/CPU
trips will be allowed to cause the severe throttling. Does this sound
good to you?

Helps a lot, thank you very much.
