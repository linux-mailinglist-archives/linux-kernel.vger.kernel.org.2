I think this check is good to have inside rcu_read_lock_bh_held(), to
highlight this scenario explicitly; I am thinking, if it makes sense to
have lock_is_held(&rcu_bh_lock_map) check in rcu_softirq_qs() ?

Also, I think this check is more important for 
rcu_read_lock_sched_held(), where lockdep state is used as a sufficient 
condition, for marking a RCU
sched region. One more api is rcu_read_lock_any_held(), where we can
warn on conflicting cases.

   int rcu_read_lock_sched_held(void)
   {
         bool ret;

         if (rcu_read_lock_held_common(&ret))
                 return ret;
         return lock_is_held(&rcu_sched_lock_map) || !preemptible();
   }
