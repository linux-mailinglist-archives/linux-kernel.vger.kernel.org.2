Yes, these memory regions are known in advance. For the empty nodes,
their 'len' property is zero and it's equal to disabled state.

I'm using the following command line to start a virtual machine (VM).
There are 4 NUMA nodes specified, but the last two are empty. In QEMU,
the device-tree nodes are populated to represent these 4 NUMA nodes.
Unfortunately, QEMU fails to start because of the conflicting names
for the empty node are found, as the following error message indicates.

According to device-tree specification, the memory device-tree node's
name is following the format 'memory@base-address'. For the empty
NUMA nodes, their base addresses aren't determined. The device-tree
specification doesn't indicate what 'base-address' should be assigned
for the empty nodes. So I proposed this patch because I think the
linux device-tree binding documentation is best place to get this
documented.

ACPI is different story. The NUMA nodes are represented by SRAT
(System Resource Affinity Table). In the above example, there are
4 SRATs. We needn't assign names to the tables and we don't have
the conflicting names as we do in device-tree case.

By the way, QEMU currently prevents to expose SRATs for empty NUMA
nodes. I need submit QEMU patch to break the limitation in future.
With the limitation, the hot-added memory is always put into the
last NUMA node and it's not exactly customer wants.

It's the way to define NUMA node IDs are valid. Besides, the 'reg'
property provides 'base-address', which is part of the device-tree
node's name, as described in this patch.
