So it looks like the PASID was bound to SVA in this design. I think it's 
not necessairly the case:

1) PASID can be implemented without SVA, in this case a map/unmap 
interface is still required
2) For the case that hypervisor want to do some mediation in the middle 
for a virtqueue. e.g in the case of control vq that is implemented in 
the VF/ADI/SF itself, the hardware virtqueue needs to be controlled by 
Qemu, Though binding qemu's page table to cvq can work but it looks like 
a overkill, a small dedicated buffers that is mapped for this PASID 
seems more suitalbe.

So do you mean the device should not expose the PASID confiugration API 
to guest? I think it could happen if we assign the whole device and let 
guest to configure it for nested VMs.
