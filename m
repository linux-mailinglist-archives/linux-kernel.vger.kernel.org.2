Assume that there is  extent  [10, 100] (ee_block=10 ee_len=91), call  
ext4_split_extent_at  split at  50,
we get two  extent [10, 49] and [50, 100], then call 
ext4_ext_insert_extent to insert  new  extent [50, 100],
if insert extent  successed, but call ext4_ext_dirty  failed(return 
-EROFS) as JBD maybe abort as io error.
Then fix  old extent  length with  old  value, so we get two extent   
[10, 100] (ee_block=10 ee_len=91) and
[50, 100](ee_block=50 ee_len=51).
If call ext4_cache_extent to cache above extents as follow:
prev = 0 lblk = 10 len = 91 --> cache  [10, 100] ---> prev = lblk + len 
= 101
prev = 101  lblk = 50 len = 51 --> prev != 0 && prev != lblk --> cache 
[prev = 101, lblk - prev = 50 - 101 = -51]
Obvious if call ext4_es_cache_extent cache  extent[101, -51] wil trigger 
"BUG_ON(end < lblk)" .

  V1 patch Ted suggest me  to fix length  only  when "err != -EROSFS". 
As if we don't
fix origin extent with old extent length, it will lead to block leak.
Ted said as follow:

If you don't want to do that, then a "do no harm" fix would be
something like this:

	...
	} else if (err == -EROFS) {
		return err;
	} else if (err)
		goto fix_extent_len;

So in the journal abort case, when err is set to EROFS, we don't try
to reset the length, since in theory the file system is read-only
already anyway.  However, in the ENOSPC case, we won't end up silently
leaking blocks that will be lost until the user somehow decides to run
fsck.
