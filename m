You also said on IRC that is a refactor of the entire driver, and not a 
blocker for this fix.  Based on that, I intrepreted your comments as 
nothing needed to be done regarding the locking, so I'm confused by this 
comment.

I'm not entirely sure what you want since I feel like you are giving 
conflicting direction, but I'm guessing you want the lock of the pm_lock 
to be moved up to just under the mutex lock then?
