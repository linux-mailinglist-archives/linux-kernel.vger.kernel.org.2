You can rename the files, you just can not rename the .ko objects
without everyone knowing what you are doing and you trying to bury it in
the middle of a differently described patch.

If you want to do that, do you?  I don't really understand why you want
to move things around right now other than "we have 40 files in one
directory, ick!".
