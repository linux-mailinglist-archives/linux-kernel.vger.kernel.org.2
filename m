I don't really see a semantic distinction between "always one-device
groups" and "groups don't matter".  Really the only way you can afford
to not care about groups is if they're singletons.

At this stage I don't really understand why that would end up so
horrible.

I don't see how the group is a fiction in this instance.  You can
still have devices that can't be isolated, therefore you can have
non-singleton groups.

Aside: I'm primarily using "group" to mean the underlying hardware
unit, not the vfio construct on top of it, I'm not sure that's been
clear throughout.

So.. your model assumes that every device has a safe quiescent state
where it won't do any harm until poked, whether its group is
currently kernel owned, or owned by a userspace that doesn't know
anything about it.

At minimum this does mean that in order to use one device in the group
you must have permission to use *all* the devices in the group -
otherwise you may be able to operate a device you don't have
permission to by DMAing to its registers from a device you do have
permission to.

Whatever scripts are managing ownership of devices also need to know
about groups, because they need to put all the devices into that
quiescent state before the group can change ownership.

Ok, I think I see your point there.
