It is mighty complicated. virtio-blk-pci-non-transitional and 
virtio-net-pci-non-transitional will give you BE, but 
virtio-crypto-pci, which is also non-transitional will get you LE,
before VERSION_1 is set (becausevirtio-crypto uses stl_le_p()). That is
fact.

The deal is that virtio-blk and virtion-net was written with
transitional in mind, and config code is the same for transitional and
non-transitional.

That is how things are now. With the QEMU changes things will be simpler.

With the future changes in QEMU, yes. Without these changes no. Without
these changes we get BE when the guest code things it is going to get
LE. That is what causes the regression.

The commit message for this patch is written from the perspective of
right now, and not from the perspective of future changes.

Or can you hack up a guest patch that looks at the revision, figures out
what endiannes is the early config access in, and does the right thing?

I don't think so. I tried to explain why that is impossible. Because
that would be preferable to messing with the the device and introducing
another exit.

Probably. I'm talking about pre- "do transport specific legacy detection
in the device instead of looking at VERSION_1" you are probably talking
about the post-state. If we had this new behavior for all relevant
hypervisors then we wouldn't need to do a thing in the guest. The current
code would work like charm.

Does that answer your question?
