Hi, Paolo

I'm trying to add support to judge if root group have pending rqs, the
implementation involve setting and clearing the busy state.

I'm thinking about setting busy in __bfq_activate_entity() if
bfq_entity_to_bfqq() return valid bfqq, however I'm not sure where to
clear the busy state.

On the other hand, do you think the way I record rq size info in patch 2
is OK? If so, I can do this the similar way: say that root group doesn't
have any pending requests if bfq haven't dispatch rq from root group for
a period of time.

Thanks
Kuai
