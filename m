Well. It is always hardirq. No spinlock_t, etc. within that callback.
If you intend to wake a thread, that thread needs an elevated priority
otherwise it won't be scheduled (assuming there is a RT tasking running
which would block otherwise ksoftirqd).

Ah. One nice thing is that you can move the RCU threads to a house
keeping CPU - away from the CPU(s) running the RT tasks. Would this
scenario be still affected (if ksoftirqd would be blocked)?

Oh. One thing I forgot to mention: the timer_list timer is nice in terms
of moving forward (the timer did not fire, the condition is true and you
move the timeout forward).
A hrtimer timer on the other hand needs to be removed, forwarded and
added back to the "timer tree". This is considered more expensive
especially if the timer does not fire.

A busy/overloaded kvm-host could lead to delays by not scheduling the
guest for a while.

My understanding of the need for RCU boosting is to get a task,
preempted (by a RT task) within a RCU section, back on the CPU to
at least close the RCU section. So it is possible to run RCU callbacks
and free memory.
The 10 seconds without RCU callbacks shouldn't be bad unless the OOM
killer got nervous (and if we had memory allocation failures).
Also, running thousands of accumulated callbacks isn't good either.
