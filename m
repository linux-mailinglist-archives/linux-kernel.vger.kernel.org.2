There is no problem, just a question before sending an update.

As you mention the #include "rpmsg_internal.h" line can be removed, I plan to
send a patch V2 for this.

That's said before sending a new version I would like to propose to also remove
the #include  <uapi/linux/rpmsg.h> line.

The rational to remove it is that include/rpmsg.h would already include
<uapi/linux/rpmsg.h> in 5.13 [2]. And looking at some frameworks (e.g I2C, TTY)
the drivers seem to include only the include/xxx.h and not the uapi/linux/xxx.h
in such case.

So my question is should I remove  #include  <uapi/linux/rpmsg.h> line? Or do
you prefer that i keep it?

Hope it is more clear... else please just forget my proposal, I wouldn't want
you to waste too much time for a point of detail.

Thanks,
Arnaud
