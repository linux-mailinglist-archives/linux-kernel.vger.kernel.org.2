What you really want is to be able to read the value using the I-cache
so as not to pollute the D-cache with code bytes and to avoid having
both an I-cache and D-cache miss at the same time for the same memory.

Even if the I-cache read took an extra clock (or two) I suspect it
would be an overall gain.
This is also true for code that uses pc-relative instructions to
read constants - common in arm-64.

Not sure any hardware lets you do that though :-(
