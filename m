I was thinking about (more-or-less hypothetical) interdependencies (see
above). But that's not terribly important.

It seems we are in violent agreement :)

It's probably most likely to hit on s390 (big-endian, and devices with a
blocksize != 512 in common use); but I'd like to make that band-aid more
generic than "exclude for s390". A hack for honouring VERSION_1 before
negotiation has finished is probably better as a stop-gap before we
manage to figure out how to deal with this properly.

I'd say we need a hack here so that we assume little-endian config space
if VERSION_1 has been offered; if your patch here works, I assume QEMU
does what we expect (assmuming little-endian as well.) I'm mostly
wondering what happens if you use a different VMM; can we expect it to
work similar to QEMU? Even if it helps for s390, we should double-check
what happens for other architectures.

Yes, I agree.

Anyone else have an idea? This is a nasty regression; we could revert the
patch, which would remove the symptoms and give us some time, but that
doesn't really feel right, I'd do that only as a last resort.
