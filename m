GPU atomic operations to sysmem are hard to categorize, because because application
programmers could easily write programs that do a long series of atomic operations.
Such a program would be a little weird, but it's hard to rule out.

That would be Jason's commit 57efa1fe59576 ("mm/gup: prevent gup_fast from racing
with COW during fork"), which is in linux-next 20201216.

This direction sounds at least...possible. Using MMU notifiers instead of pins
is definitely appealing. I'm not quite clear on the callback idea above, but
overall it seems like taking advantage of the ZONE_DEVICE tracking of pages
(without having to put anything additional in each struct page), could work.

Additional notes or ideas here are definitely welcome.
