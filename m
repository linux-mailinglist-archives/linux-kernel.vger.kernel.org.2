What do you mean by "production unwinders"?  Generally unwinders rely on
either frame pointers or DWARF, but (without validation) those aren't
robust enough for live patching in the kernel, so I'm not sure how this
is relevant.

You're taking the two absolute worst case scenarios (one of which is
just a patch which doesn't look like it's going to get merged anyway)
and drawing a false narrative.

In this case the simplest approach would have been to just give up and
disable jump tables.

We try as hard as possible (beyond turning objtool into a full emulator)
to avoid doing that kind of thing because objtool isn't supposed to
dictate kernel optimizations.  Otherwise we would have disabled jump
tables (even for non-retpolines) a long time ago, because that's been a
serious PITA.

You might not like the plugin -- I don't like it either -- but the goal
was to avoid penalizing the kernel with "objtool-friendly"
optimizations.

That said, jump tables are such a pain for objtool (and currently
impossible to deal with for arm64) that I'm completely open to just
disabling them if they're shown to have negligible benefit for the
kernel.
