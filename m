Thank you for this educational scolding here and below. I see that
problem here is more fundamental than I thought before and my commit
messages standards are too low for you.
Good to see that bug that may exist since 2013 could be fixed finally.

To match cpuhp_smt_enable().

My bad.

Why while you're on this I need to ask one question about:
* ...cpu maps lock
* needs to be held as this might race against in kernel
* abusers of the hotplug machinery (thermal management).

Who are the abusers of hotplug from the thermal management side?
I spent (wasted) a considerable amount of time searching for them in
drivers/thermal/* but nothing seemed suspicious.

It was not mentioned in commit messages. It was mentioned in the place
that describes changes between different versions of the patch.
There is already a place in device_online() and device_offline() where
uevent() is sent under lock(sysfs) lock only (in your notation) and
outside cpu_maps lock (the same goes for dev->offline status). IIRC
that's why I didn't explain it specifically.
Will do better in future.

That's correct: there is no explanation.
Before it became more fundamental and about consistency of hotplug
state, this was done to perform one cpusets_wait_for_hotplug() after
all hotplug calls rather than doing cpusets_wait_for_hotplug() for
each individual cpu_up/cpu_down.

I'll give it a go and get back to you. It seems this patch should work.
