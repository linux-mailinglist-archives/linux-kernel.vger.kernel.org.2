Wouldn't be much simpler to do something like this?

		if (discard_bio) {
-			submit_bio_wait(discard_bio);
-			bio_put(discard_bio);
+			submit_bio(discard_bio);
		}


We're throwing away the return value from submit_bio_wait(), so
there's no real need to wait for I/O to complete so we can fetch the
I/O status.

That way we don't need to move all of this to a kworker context.
