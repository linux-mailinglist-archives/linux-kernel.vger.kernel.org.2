Not really, no.
The userspace application would need to respawn, or some systemd (or
similar process manager) would need to respawn the application it
should recover the state, and communication should resume normally.
I think this message is good mostly as informative.

It's not actionable unfortunately.
But I feel it is useful to have this message, until the application recovers.
Mostly to be informative.
A more robust mechanism would be to setup some counters, where we
count the number of missed messages.
And then access this counter via sysfs or something.

The problem is that a high-rate of dev_warn() (during failure),
temporarily increases system CPU usage & load-average, making the
recovery a bit slower, because systemd-journald is processing these
messages from the kernel.
So, dev_dbg() would definitely help, but would also require us to bump
the system log-level to see the messages.
And if they occur and we don't see them, it causes more questions and
debugging, because people won't know for sure what the issue is.

Ultimately, dev_dbg() or dev_warn_rate_limited() are both fine.
The goal is to avoid the temporary increase in CPU load.
I just wanted to state my arguments for dev_warn_ratelimite() :)

Thank you
Alex
