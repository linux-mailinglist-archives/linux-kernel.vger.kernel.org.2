My goal is to avoid having a dead code. Three options come to mind.

The first would be to add another #ifdef SOMETHING (suggest a name).
But this doesn't remove the code and someone could enable it by accident.

The second would be to add the code in a block comment. Then document
that it is for checking an invariant. This will make it harder to cause
problems.

The third would be to remove the code and explain the invariant in a block
comment. Maybe add a pseudo code too in the comment.

What do you think?

Good idea. I will do that too.

Agreed. For now I only want to focus on the "if (0)".
