I looked over.  One potential issue is both sgx_encl and sgx_vepc have 'struct mutex lock'
embedded,  but mutex_destroy() is not called when they are released.  However I am not
sure whether this is worth fixing, since mutex_destroy() is empty unless
CONFIG_DEBUG_MUTEXES is turned on (even with it turned on, mutex_destroy() doesn't do
anything like freeing resources so in practice there should have no problem).

Another thing is sgx_encl_release() doesn't explicitly call xa_erase() for each EPC page
in encl->page_array when looping it over to free all EPC pages, but I think it is OK since
xa_destroy() is called later which will destroy all xarray internal data structures.  But
I don't know internal implementation of xarray.

It might be useful but I don't think it can detect things like xa_destroy() being missing.

Thank you!
