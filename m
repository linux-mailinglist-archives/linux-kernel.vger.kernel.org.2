So I found a no-name el-cheapo card that has some issues with MSI:

18:00.0 Serial controller: Device 1c00:3253 (rev 10) (prog-if 05 [16850])

The card comes with two serial lines. It comes perfectly up, if I enable
it to use MSI in the whitelist:

serial 0000:18:00.0: Using MSI(-X) interrupts
serial 0000:18:00.0: Setup PCI port: port 40c0, irq 104, type 0
0000:18:00.0: ttyS6 at I/O 0x40c0 (irq = 104, base_baud = 115200) is a
XR16850
serial 0000:18:00.0: Setup PCI port: port 40c8, irq 104, type 0
0000:18:00.0: ttyS7 at I/O 0x40c8 (irq = 104, base_baud = 115200) is a
XR16850

After loading 8250_pci, lspci -vvs 18:0.0 tells:

	Capabilities: [68] MSI: Enable+ Count=1/32 Maskable+ 64bit+
		Address: 00000000fee000b8  Data: 0000
		Masking: ffffffff  Pending: 00000000

Looks good so far. Now let's echo to the device.

$ echo asdf > /dev/ttyS6

-- stuck. The echoing process stucks at close():

write(1, "asdf\n", 5)                   = 5
close(1

Stuck in the sense of: the echo is still killable, no crashes. The same
happens if I try to access the device with stty. So something is odd
here. However, the Netmos cards that I whitelisted do a great job.

So I can't tell if I was just unlucky to grab a card that has issues
with MSI, and this is an exception rather than the rule…

HTH,
  Ralf
