This feature should be supported in the SMMUv3 PMU kernel driver and 
perf tool.

However it relies on the SMMU PMU identifier sysfs file to work. This 
relies on SMMU_PMCG_IIDR being set, which is introduced latest spec, 
which not much HW will support yet - see commit 2c255223362e. In theory 
we don't need that for the fixed, non-IMPDEF events, but I did not 
complicate perf tool with that mixed support.

That's the reason for which I paused smmuv3-pmcg.json upstream in [3]. I 
will revive that for new gen HW when concrete IMPDEF events known and 
shared.

Thanks,
John
