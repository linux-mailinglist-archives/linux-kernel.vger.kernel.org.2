Ah that's a very good idea, descriptor does contain the module, file name.
We can probably even pass the module name,file name as string from the 
descriptor itself to event?
Perhaps we can do that for all trace events and not just this trace 
event? Just like the trace event name displayed
with trace events, perhaps have file name,module name displayed when 
dynamic debug is enabled? Filtering by
filename is pretty useful since most of these usecases in debugging will 
be with respect to some driver or subsystems.

Thanks,
Sai
