No, it was pure hypothetical assumption.
I was thinking about it over the weekend, and decided that:
a) such kind of issue (i.e. vmalloc call in rollback after failed vmalloc)
   is very unlikely
b) if it still exists -- it must have own failback with kmalloc(NOFAIL) 
   or just accept/ignore such failure and should not lead to critical failures.
   If this still happen -- ihis is a bug, we should detect and fix it ASAP.

Last question:
how do you think, should we perhaps, instead, detect such vmallocs 
(called in rollback after failed vmalloc) and generate a warnings,
to prevent such kind of problems in future?

Thank you,
