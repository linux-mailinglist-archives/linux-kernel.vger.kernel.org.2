This is almost exactly what I was intending to implement except for one
more change. The state of the mux will always be represented using the
second argument(i.e. #mux-control-cells = <2>).

For example,
mux-controls = <&mux 0 1>, <&mux 1 0>;


With this I think we wouldn't need a special value for all or many states.

Sure, I think making a change in

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mux/gpio-mux.yaml, should be good
enough I assume.


Thank you for the comments. I'll post a respin of this series, with the
above changes.

Thanks,
