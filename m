Nit: do not use hyphens for limited mode. 'limited_mode' is fine. I'm
also fine with just limited_mode.

This is blacklisting. E.g. I'm not sure why all of the sysfs attributes
would still be exported. Some of them use TPM commands. That was just
one random example I came up with.

It's easy to come up other examples, like, why you provide still tpmrm0,
which is dependent on a TPM running normal mode?

This misses completely the rationale for ever acking this change: which
parts of the uapi are export and *why*.

Please whitelist the things that should still work. Even the obvious
ones like /dev/tpm0 (because of TPM_RC_UPGRADE).

This is clearly a faulty and incomplete patch in its current form.
