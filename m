But won't that just lower the performance state requested by the
&mdss_mdp, while the &mdss still votes for NOM - with the outcome being
that we maintain NOM even if the clock goes down?

It doesn't make sense to me that a lone power_on on the power-domain
wouldn't give us enough juice to poke the registers.

But digging into the rpmhpd implementation answers the question, simply
invoking rpmhpd_power_on() is a nop, unless
rpmhpd_set_performance_state() has previously been called, because
pd->corner is 0. So this explains why enable isn't sufficient.

Compare this with the rpmpd implementation that will send an
enable request to the RPM in this case.

Per above finding you're right, enabling a rpmhpd power-domain doesn't
do anything. And I don't find this intuitive or even in line with the
expectations of the api...



A quick test booting rb3 and rb5 seems to indicate that it's possible to
initialize pd->corner to 1 (to ensure that enable at least gives us the
lowest level).

set_performance_state(0) will however then result in voting for "off",
rather than the lowest enabled level.


Rajendra, Stephen, is this really how rpmhpd is supposed to work?!
