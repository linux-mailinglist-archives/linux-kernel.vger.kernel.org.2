Actually, I understand your intention is to implement functions which
can be applied to control all UHS-II cards.
However, why do I choose to base it on =E2=80=9C[RFC,v3.1,00/27] Add suppor=
t
UHS-II for GL9755=E2=80=9D?
Because it contains a complete UHS-II interface(both host & card side)
and UHS-II card can work normally.

The functionality of uhs2.c in the previous version of $subject almost
equal to sd_uhs2.c in your series [1].
The only difference is that UHS-II card initialization flow had been
modulated according to different phases(detect / phy_init /
legacy_init=E2=80=A6).
Hence, I decided to apply your architecture of sd_uhs2.c to uhs2.c and
rename uhs2.c to sd_uhs2.c.

All patches are briefed below:
1. Patch #1 to patch #26 are used to create a UHS-II interface, both
in host side and sd card side.
    -  patch#1: add UHS-II support in public headers. (include/linux/mmc).
    -  patch#2: add UHS-II relative features in mmc_power_up() /
mmc_power_off() / mmc_regulator_get_supply().
    -  patch#3: skip set_chip_select().
    -  patch#4: flow of =E2=80=9Cinterface selection and initialization=E2=
=80=9D was a
bit modified for UHS-II card.
    -  patch#5: skip TMODE(field of UHS-II command packet) setup in some ca=
ses.
    -  patch#6 - #7: generate UHS-II SD command packet.
    -  patch#8: add a kernel configuration for enabling UHS-II support.
    -  patch#9: add UHS-II related definitions in sdhci.h and sdhci-uhs2.h.
    -  patch#10: add sdhci-uhs2.c as a module for UHS-II support.
    -  patch#11: dump UHS-II registers
    -  patch#12 - #26: add UHS-II host setting / control / attach,
card detect / attach.
2. Patch #27: drivers/mmc/host/sdhci-pci-gli.c contains
vendor(Genesyslogic) specific operations which are related to hardware
control.
3. Patch #28: remove redundant code.
4. Patch #29: move code from uhs2.c to sd_uhs2.c and place them to
proper functions.

Okay.

So what is the next you suggest to do after my explanation?
1. Update cover letter & change note in current version of $subject.
2. Submit a new version on top of your series [1].
    For example: Series =E2=80=9CAdd Support UHS-II for GL9755=E2=80=9C
    patch #1~#4 are your original series[1] and patch #33 is to apply
your patch to support UHS-II cards. Below is the patch list:
    [0/33] mmc: core: Add Support UHS-II for GL9755
    [1/33] mmc: core: Cleanup printing of speed mode at card insertion
    [2/33] mmc: core: Prepare to support SD UHS-II cards
    [3/33] mmc: core: Announce successful insertion of an SD UHS-II card
    [4/33] mmc: core: Extend support for mmc regulators with a vqmmc2
    [5/33] mmc: add UHS-II related definitions in public headers
    [6/33] mmc: core: UHS-II support, modify power-up sequence
    =E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6
    [33/33] mmc: core: Apply Ulf's patch for supporting UHS-II car

> > Changes in v3 (Jul. 10, 2020)
> > * rebased to v5.8-rc4
> > * add copyright notice
> > * reorganize the patch set and split some commits into smaller ones
> > * separate uhs-2 headers from others
> > * correct wrong spellings
> > * fix most of checkpatch warnings/errors
> > * remove all k[cz]alloc() from the code
> > * guard sdhci-uhs2 specific code with
