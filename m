Seems like I got what you are looking for. Let me try to explain the 
reasoning
and doubts regarding what I meant under my change.

According to my previous comments the reason of the change is to provide 
a way
to user-space application to safely perform the TPM firmware update and 
cover
all corner cases like power failure, corrupted firmware image, bad
communication channel and so on.

In original implementation, if TPM is in Upgrade or Failure (some 
vendors call
it Reduced) mode the driver will simple fail during initialization and 
will not
provide any conventional way for the user-space application to address the
situation.

So the fix changes the behavior of `tpm_chip_start` function in a way 
that it
will try to distinguish between actual TPM start failure and  having TPM in
Upgrade/Failure mode.

The Upgrade mode is easy to distinguish. According to the TPM 
specification, in
this mode the TPM will answer to only 2 calls: 
`TPM_CC_FieldUpgradeStart` and
`TPM_CC_FieldUpgradeData`. It will respond `TPM_RC_UPGRADE` to any other 
call.

Failure mode, as mentioned earlier, a bit trickier, but possible to detect.
In this mode very limited functionality is supported as TPM runs some 
form of
fallback firmware or in fallback mode due to failure of upgrade. Different
vendors implement it slightly different. The way how the fix tries to 
address
this mode is by making sure that `TPM_CC_SelfTest` and `TPM_CC_Startup` are
executed correctly but all the consequent calls to address crypto 
functionality
of the TPM are failing. In other words, functions like 
`tpm2_get_cc_attrs_tbl`,
`tpm_add_hwrng` and `tpm_get_pcr_allocation` will fail.

Below you also can find more detailed comments inline regarding every 
part of
the change.

Important to note that the fix addresses only TPM2.0 compatible devices 
as that
is what I am working with.

Introduce this flat to mark that TPM is in Upgrade/Failure mode and the
functionality is limited.

As described earlier, during startup we can distinguish what mode TPM is
running in.

So check the return value here and set limited_mode flag accordingly.

I am not sure that returning one of the errno values here is good choice
as it might correlate with legit error returned by hardware 
communication layer.
Any comments/suggestions are welcome.

As mentioned above, if TPM is in Upgrade/Failure mode, the call to
tpm_get_pcr_allocation will 100% fail, so avoid calling it.

Same as with tpm_get_pcr_allocation. Call to tpm_add_hwrng will fail when
limited_mode is set to true;

Checking explicitly if TPM is in Upgrade mode. If it is, return immediately
as all other calls (except Firmware upgrade ones) to TPM will be failing.

If execution context reaches this point but fails here, the conclusion 
can be
drawn that that TPM is in Failure mode and needs recovery. Indicate it by
settings appropriate return value and exit.

Hope that's give a bit more light to what is it all about. Let me know 
if you
have any other questions, I would be glad to help.
