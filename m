I won't comment on the sanity of the feature but I will say that calling
it oops_on_warn (rather than pkill_on_warn), and using the usual oops
facilities rather than rolling oops by hand sounds like a better
implementation.

Especially as calling do_group_exit(SIGKILL) from a random location is
not a clean way to kill a process.  Strictly speaking it is not even
killing the process.

Partly this is just me seeing the introduction of a
do_group_exit(SIGKILL) call and not likely the maintenance that will be
needed.  I am still sorting out the problems with other randomly placed
calls to do_group_exit(SIGKILL) and interactions with ptrace and
PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT in particular.

Which is a long winded way of saying if I can predictably trigger a
warning that calls do_group_exit(SIGKILL), on some architectures I can
use ptrace and  can convert that warning into a way to manipulate the
kernel stack to have the contents of my choice.

If anyone goes forward with this please use the existing oops
infrastructure so the ptrace interactions and anything else that comes
up only needs to be fixed once.

Eric
