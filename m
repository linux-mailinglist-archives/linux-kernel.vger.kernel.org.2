It would be nice to do, because I have also made similar fixes before. We looked at the STRICT option
in the parser (https://github.com/zserge/jsmn), but even then it seems to allow trailing commas.

Trailing commas are not allowed in the json standard, but there is a split between parsers
where some allow it and others don't. Specifically the Python parser doesn't allow it, and Python
can easily be involved in some workflow that parses these files.

The only way forwards I can think of is either getting a change accepted upstream to the parser
and then updating it in perf, switching to a different parser, or doing some hack to add an extra
step in perf to look for commas. None of which sound ideal.
