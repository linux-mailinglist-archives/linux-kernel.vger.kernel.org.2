Thanks for the explanation, makes sense. If I am not mistaken, I see 
that
you are suggesting to move this logic based on size and granule-size to
arm-smmu-v2 driver and one more thing below..

You are also hinting to not do this for all SMMUv2 implementations and 
make
it QCOM specific?

If I am wrong in my assumptions here, please let me know otherwise I 
will
prepare the patch :)
