Yeah agreed. Adding new devicetree properties should not be a problem
for device drivers.

For renamed devicetree properties, the driver won't be aware of them
if a newer dtb is used. The only thing the driver can possibly do at
this point is maybe warn about some missing old property and bail out.

Making sure the driver changes are in place first helps a bit..
But naturally fixing the driver in advance won't help booting kernels
before the driver changes with a newer dtb :)

What helps though is to make sure git bisect works for building and
booting already at -rc1 kernel to make debugging the issue easy. As
-rc1 is used typically as the merge base the problem causing branches
can be tested separately that way.

Tony
