And I think here we found the misconception.

- SP800-90A section 8.7.1 clearly marks that a personalization string is
optional. If it is not provided, the personalization string is treated as a
zero-bit string in the formulas you mentioned above. This is also consistent
with the CAVP testing of DRBGs conducted by NIST which allows testing of the
DRBG without a personalization string. See [1] as an example (search for DRBG
and click on it to see the tested options - there you see the testing with
zero personalization string).

- SP800-90A section 9.1 specifies that the entropy_input is: "The maximum
length of the entropy_input is implementation dependent, but shall be less
than or equal to the specified maximum length for the selected DRBG
mechanism". For all DRBGs except the CTR DRBG without derivation function the
maximum length is 2^35 as defined in table 2. As we do not have a CTR DRBG
without derivation function, we can ignore that special case.

With these considerations, the current DRBG code

- does not mandate a personalization string or even create one by itself but
allows the caller to specify one

- applies an entropy_input len of 512 bits during initial seeding

- applies a nonce of 128 bits during initial seeding

entropy_input == <384 bits get_random_bytes> || <256 bits Jitter RNG>

nonce = 128 bits Jitter RNG


You asked why 384 bits from get_random_bytes. Well, the answer is exactly to
cover your initial concern also raised by James Morris: some folks may not
trust the Jitter RNG. Yet we need it here as it only provides 90B compliance.
But folks who dislike it can treat its data providing no entropy and assume
get_random_bytes provides the entropy.

As both, the get_random_bytes and Jitter RNG data is concatenated, we do not
destroy entropy by this operation. This implies we cover different view points
at the same time.
