Yes.  The structure was made to not change anything unnecessarily
(such as the ordering in sigqueue_alloc) and the performances
differences went away.

With the code in linux-next the entire cycle I think that is a reliable
result.  There are probably some things we could do to further optimize
things but we did not need them to avoid regressions.

Yes.  I suspect that those tests are left over from a previous version
of the change.  Alex do you remember why those tests are there?

Just reading through the resolution looks correct.
