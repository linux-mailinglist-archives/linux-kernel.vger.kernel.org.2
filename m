From: Amir Mizinski <amirmizi6@gmail.com>

This patch set adds support for TPM devices that implement the I2C.
Interface defined by TCG PTP specification:
https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TCG_PC_Client_Platform_TPM_Profile_PTP_2.0_r1.03_v22.pdf

The driver was tested on Raspberry-Pie 3, using Nuvoton NPCT75X TPM.

Interrupts are not implemented yet, preparing it for the next patch.
This patch is based on initial work by oshri Alkoby, Alexander Steffen and Christophe Ricard
