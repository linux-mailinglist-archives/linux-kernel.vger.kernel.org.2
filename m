Given likely movement of various common server/client functions into
cifs_common in the short term - we can delay renaming "fs/cifs"
(and fs/cifs_common) to e.g. "fs/smbfs" to 5.16 or 5.17

"smbfs" would likely be fine and I can bounce the idea around
others on Samba team etc.  And yes you are right, the broader
"SMB family of protocols" covers a lot of other functions
(from systems management, DCE/RPC, clustering, change notification,
named pipes, global name space ... not just files and printers) so "smbfs"
as a name for the client fs module going forward may be a bit less confusing.

That should be easy enough (IIRC FreeBSD called their
module "smbfs), but presumably wait until 5.16 or 5.17
to lessen merge conflicts etc.
