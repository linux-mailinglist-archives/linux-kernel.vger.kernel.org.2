Where is that written down?

what is the PRIM_TZ bit? I don't see it in my reference manual
(which is for the LS1028A).

Can't we just do a
if (rd_reg32(&ctrl->jr_mid[ring].liodn_ms) &
     (MSTRID_LOCK_TZ_OWN | MSTRID_LOCK_PRIM_TZ))
	continue;

This isn't really used at all. Can we drop "jr" from
struct caam_drv_private altogether? See also below.

as well as this?

Is anything preventing from total_jobrs getting big? Can't
we get rid of this static variable somehow? Before this commit,
it was just used for messages. Can we check the TZ bit here
instead of doing that bitflags dance?

nitpick: in caam there are no netdev comments. So multiline
comments look like:
/*
  * this is a comment.

can't find that one.

in general, does these marcros match with your reference
manual? Which one do you have?

for me the bits are named:
LICID[31], AMTD[16], TZ[15] and SDID[11:0]
also the register is called JRnICID.

I wonder if the LS1028A has a newer/older CAAM version.
according to the device tree (fsl-ls1028a.dtsi) the
sec is v5.0 (and also compatible with v4.0). If you
have a look at the RM it says 7.0 (at least the MAJ_VER
in SECVID_MS is 7 accoring to the manual; i haven't
checked on the hardware for now.

Horia, can you shed some light here.
