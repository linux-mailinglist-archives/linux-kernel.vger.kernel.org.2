Sergey, I think that you talk about the crash where there is no registered
console and console_on_rootfs() fails to create stdin, stdout, and
stderr for the init process. As a result the kernel crashes
during boot.

But the bugreport says that the system booted. It crashed later during
reboot. It will likely be in the shutdown phase. It still might be still
be caused by the missing console. But we should rule out other
problems.

James, do you see the problem:

  1. When there is a real console registered. When you remove the
     wrong console= parameter.

  2. When using "reboot -f" so that the system reboots a dirty way
     without trying to shut down services.

Best Regards,
Petr
