Just to be super clear. Do we allocate a FD for each PASID and return the
FD to the user? Or return the plain PASID number back to the user space?

Seems you are talking about two FDs:
- /dev/ioasid FD
- per IOASID FD
This API ioasid = get_pasid_from_fd(dev_ioasid_fd, ioasid_fd);
dev_ioasid_fd will find the xarray for all the PASIDs allocated under it,
ioasid_fd wil be the index into the xarray to retrieve the actual ioasid.
Correct?

OK, if we have per IOASID FD in addition to the /dev/ioasid FD we can
validate user input.

Sounds good, one xarray per /dev/ioasid FD.

OK, one per subsystem-VM. For example, if a VM has a VFIO and a VDPA
device, it should only two /dev/ioasid FDs respectively. Correct?

Why separate? I don't see a use case to just authorize a PASID but don't
bind it with a page table. The very act of bind page table *is* the
authorization.

Just a little background here. We have been working on the vSVA stack
since 2017. At the time, VFIO was the de facto interface for IOMMU-aware
driver framework. These uAPIs were always developed alone side with the
accompanying VFIO patches served as consumers. By the time these IOMMU uAPIs
were merged after reviews from most vendors, the VFIO patchset was
approaching maturity in around v7. This is when we suddenly saw a new
request to support VDPA, which attempted VFIO earlier but ultimately moved
away.

For a complex stack like vSVA, I feel we have to reduce moving parts and do
some divide and conquer.
