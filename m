I think u16 is more precise than int, but I think it'll get promoted to an 
int anywhen when used with calls to pci_read_config_dword().  Was this 
change tested on real or emulated HW?

I agree that a single Vendor/VSEC id being supported is a problem, 
but I think fixing it should be a separate patch.  Do we need to change 
this a table lookup of Vendor/VSEC id's, or do we need to reserve a more 
generic Vendor/VSEC pair?
