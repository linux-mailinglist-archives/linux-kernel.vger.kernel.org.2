Andrew, could you please clarify how we can do it?
Do you mean we can use exsiting allocation fault injection infrastructure to trigger
such kind of issues? Unfortunately I found no ways to reach this goal.
It  allows to emulate single faults with small probability, however it is not enough,
we need to completely disable all vmalloc allocations. 
I've tried to extend fault injection infrastructure however found that it is not trivial.

That's why I've added direct fatal_signal_pending() check into my patch.

You are right, I've missed it.
However __alloc_pages_bulk() can return no new pages without my patch too:
- due to fault injection inside  prepare_alloc_pages()
- if __rmqueue_pcplist() returns NULL and if array already had some assigned pages,
- if both __rmqueue_pcplist() and following __alloc_pages(0) cannot get any page.
On the other hand I cannot say that it is 100% xfs-related issue, it looks strange
but they have some chance to get page after few attemps.

So I think I can change 'break' to 'goto failed_irq', call __alloc_pages(0) and
return 1 page. It seems is handled correctly in all callers too.

Comments in description of __vmalloc_node() and kvmalloc() claim that __GFP_NOFAIL is not supported,
I did not found any other callers used this flag.
