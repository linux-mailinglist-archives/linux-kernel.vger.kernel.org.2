Maybe we should rename some of the functions and variables if there is
confusion, but I think this new group is "all" rather than "other" because
it also includes all the events that would be put in other groups.

If we can use the transaction field to distinguish sample types, I'm
wondering why we need the separate groups at all. If this new group
includes all sample types, and they're all labelled, do we need to
continue with the other groups like "tlb-access" and "branch-miss"?

Or does the perf GUI not allow filtering by transaction type?
