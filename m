(this is me "writing out loud" to make sure I can follow)

I take it the preemption of rcuc/x itself would count as a quiescent state,
if the current grace period started before rcuc/x's rcu_read_lock()
(rcuc/x would end up in ->blkd_tasks but wouldn't affect ->gp_tasks).

Then if we get something to run rcu_report_qs_rnp() with a mask spanning
CPU x - I think the GP kthread doing quiescent state forcing might fit the
bill - we'll let the GP kthread initialize a new GP.

Right

If, as described in your scenario above, the GP kthread has preempted
rcuc/x, initialized a new GP and has run __note_gp_changes() (on CPU x),
then wouldn't the rdp->gp_seq and rnp->gp_seq match when rcuc/x gets to run
again?

And because we would've then had a context switch between the GP kthread
and rcuc/x, we would've noted a quiescent state for CPU x, which would let
rcuc/x's rcu_report_qs_rdp() continue - or have I erred on the way there?

I have some notes scribbled down regarding those that I need to go through

It would still have to be in a #define CONFIG_RCU_NOCB_CPU region IMO, as
it only exists to protect access of the offloading state - hence the name,
but I'm not particularly attached to it.

AFAICT the problem only stands if core processing becomes preemptible,
which is only the case under PREEMPT_RT (at least for now), and that implies
core processing done purely via kthreads.

It does look like the first/only place that tries to access a local_lock's
dep_map regardless of CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT. Looking at it some more, I'm not
sure if it's really useful: !PREEMPT_RT local_locks disable preemption, so
the preemption check in rcu_rdp_is_offloaded() will short circuit the
lockdep check when !PREEMPT_RT...

One thing I should perhaps point out - the local lock is only really needed
for PREEMPT_RT; for !PREEMPT_RT it will just disable preemption, and it's
only used in places that *already* disabled preemption (when !PREEMPT_RT).
I initially gated the lock under CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT, but changed that as I
found it reduced the ifdeffery.

This follows the !CONFIG_RCU_NOCB definition of rcu_lockdep_is_held_nocb(),
which looked fine to me.

Actually with the way I wrote rcu_local_offload_access_safe(), we don't
even access that function when !CONFIG_RCU_NOCB...

I _assumed_ the check was there even for !CONFIG_RCU_NOCB to provide a wider
test coverage of the calling conditions.

If that RCU_LOCKDEP_WARN() becomes conditionnal on CONFIG_RCU_NOCB then
yes, we could clean that up.
