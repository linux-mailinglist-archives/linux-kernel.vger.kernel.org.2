Does this look better?

Subject: [PATCH] memcg: fix up drain_local_stock comment

Thomas and Vlastimil have noticed that the comment in drain_local_stock
doesn't quite make sense. It talks about a synchronization with the
memory hotplug but there is no actual memory hotplug involvement here.
I meant to talk about cpu hotplug here. Fix that up and hopefuly make
the comment more helpful by referencing the cpu hotplug callback as
well.
