The problem is that even if you'll serve the oom daemon task with pages
from a reserve/custom pool, it doesn't guarantee anything, because the task
still can wait for a long time on some mutex, taken by another process,
throttled somewhere in the reclaim. You're basically trying to introduce a
"higher memory priority" and as always in such cases there will be priority
inversion problems.

So I doubt that you can simple create a common mechanism which will work
flawlessly for all kinds of allocations, I anticipate many special cases
requiring an individual approach.

Yeah, I thought about something like this, but I didn't go too deep.
Basically we can emulate __GFP_NOFS | __GFP_NORETRY, but I'm not sure
we can apply it for any random allocation without bad consequences.

Btw, this approach can be easily prototyped using bpf: a bpf program
can be called on each allocation and modify the behavior based on
the pid of the process and other circumstances.

First, I need to admit that I didn't follow the bpf development too close
for last couple of years, so my knowledge can be a bit outdated.

But in general bpf is great when there is a fixed amount of data as input
(e.g. skb) and a fixed output (e.g. drop/pass the packet). There are different
maps which are handy to store some persistent data between calls.

However traversing complex data structures is way more complicated. It's
especially tricky if the data structure is not of a fixed size: bpf programs
have to be deterministic, so there are significant constraints on loops.

Just for example: it's easy to call a bpf program for each task in the system,
provide some stats/access to some fields of struct task and expect it to return
an oom score, which then the kernel will look at to select the victim.
Something like this can be done with cgroups too.

Writing a kthread, which can sleep, poll some data all over the system and
decide what to do (what oomd/... does),  will be really challenging.
And going back, it will not provide any guarantees unless we're not taking
any locks, which is already quite challenging.
