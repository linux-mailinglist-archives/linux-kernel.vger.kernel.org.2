Hi There!

Because this is a global variable, it appears to be exploitable. Either we generate a sufficient number of processes to achieve this counter, or you increase the open file limit with ulimit or sysctl. Unless the kernel has a hard restriction on the number of potential file descriptors that I'm not aware of.

In any case, it's probably a good idea to patch this to make it explicitly secure. If you discover a hard-limit in the kernel for open file descriptors, please let me know. I'm genuinely â€‹interested :D!

Best Regards,

Jordy
