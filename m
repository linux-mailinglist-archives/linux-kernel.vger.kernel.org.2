That's the 3rd version of this series since Friday, two of them during
the merge window. All you are achieving is to actually *delay* the
review process (at this rate, I'll probably wait until v11 before I
take another look at it).

Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst states it clearly:

Wait for a minimum of one week before resubmitting
</quote>

So please leave people the time to actually do a good review job, and
take the opportunity to review your own patches before posting them
again.

Thanks,

	M.
