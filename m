Hi Herve,

In general I prefer when acronyms use upper cases (NANDs, MTD, etc).
Please also do the change in the other commits.

Saying "timing setting were incorrect on some nands" is inaccurate. I
think we can clearly state that "Under certain circumstances, the
timing settings calculated by the FSMC NAND controller driver were
inaccurate." (no need to precise a NAND device here).

We generally use the declarative tense here, such as "Add this
constraint and fixes..." even though I would happily reformulate with
something like "Enhance the timings calculation by taking into account
this additional constraint."

And then you can provide your results, how it behaved with the two
NANDs and what improvement you bring with this additional calculation.

A few visual changes explained below otherwise the logic is fine.

These two information should be placed close to TOUTDEL and TINDEL
definitions (see my comment below).

The style here is wrong, you need spaces before and after a "*".

Please also enclose these two multiplications with parenthesis to make
it clear that you do not intend to multiply 7000 nor 5000.

Finally, do not use open coded values, please define them at the top so
that your code matches your commit message (using TOUTDEL and TINDEL).
You can even add a comment explaining from where you got these values.

I don't like the tmp naming, you could call this variable twait_min and
use a min() calculation here to fit the manual better.
