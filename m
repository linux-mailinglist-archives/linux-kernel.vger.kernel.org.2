The DCC is a DMA engine designed to store register values either in
case of a system crash or in case of software triggers manually done
by the user.Using DCC hardware and the sysfs interface of the driver
the user can exploit various functionalities of DCC.The user can specify
the register addresses,the values of which is stored by DCC in it's
dedicated SRAM.The register addresses can be used either to read from,
write to,first read and store value and then write or to loop.All these
options can be exploited using the sysfs interface given to the user.
Following are the sysfs interfaces exposed in DCC driver which are
documented
1)trigger
2)config
3)config_write
4)config_reset
5)enable
6)rd_mod_wr
7)loop

+Description:
+		This file allows the software trigger to be enabled
+		by the user through the sysfs interface.Through this
+		interface the user can manually start a software trigger
+		in dcc where by the dcc driver stores the current status
+		of the specified registers in dcc sram.

+Description:
+		This file allows the user to manually enable or
+		disable dcc driver.The dcc hardware needs to be
+		enabled before use.

+Date:           February 2021
+Contact:        Souradeep Chowdhury <schowdhu@codeaurora.org>
+Description:
+		This file allows user to configure the register values
+		along with addresses to the dcc driver.This register
+		addresses are used to read from,write or loop through.
+		To enable all these options separate sysfs files have
+		are created.

+Date:           February 2021
+Contact:        Souradeep Chowdhury <schowdhu@codeaurora.org>
+Description:
+		This file allows user to write a value to the register
+		address given as argument.The values are entered in the

+Contact:        Souradeep Chowdhury <schowdhu@codeaurora.org>
+Description:
+		This file is used to enter the loop count as dcc
