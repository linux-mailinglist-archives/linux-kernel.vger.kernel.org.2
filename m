Subject: THANKS FOR YOUR RESPONSE AND GOD BLESS
.
Dearest one,

I know it might be difficult for you to believe me because of the high
rate of scam going round the internet. I am not asking for money in
any way and i do not need your financial assistance but to plead in
the name of god, please grant the last wish of a dying man. I want my
only adopted son to come over to your country and I promised to pay
for whatever is going to cost and also give you enough money to help
me establish his future there in your country.

I'm   Mr.LAWRENCE TANSANCO Y., 65yrs old, suffering from cancer of the
lungs. From the doctor's report, I do not have much time to live and
my son's future is bothering me so much. He is just 16yrs old and I
want the best for him. I don't want to imagine him suffering when I
leave this world. Help me accept him as a son, friend, brother and be
his guardian. Please, accept my last wish for the sake of god and
humanity.

I will be glad to hear from you please. Put me in your prayers and
please god will bless you and your family.

Thanks
Mr. LAWRENCE TANSANCO Y.
