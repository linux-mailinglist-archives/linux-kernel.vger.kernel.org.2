I have tentatively pulled it in for review and testing.

In the shorter term...  PVCLOCK_GUEST_STOPPED is mostly for things like
guest migration and debugger breakpoints, correct?  Either way, I am
wondering if rcu_cpu_stall_reset() should take a lighter touch.  Right
now, it effectively disables all stalls for the current grace period.
Why not make it restart the stall timeout when the stoppage is detected?

The strange thing is that unless something is updating the jiffies counter
to make it look like the system was up during the stoppage time interval,
there should be no reason to tell RCU anything.  Is the jiffies counter
updated in this manner?  (Not seeing it right offhand, but I don't claim
to be familiar with this code.)

							Thanx, Paul
