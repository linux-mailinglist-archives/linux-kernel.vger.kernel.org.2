No, this is not true. If CONFIG_LSM is defined to "lockdown,yama,bpf"
and if the kernel command line contains "security=selinux" without any
"lsm" parameter, then SELinux is not enabled properly.

This broke the configuration of several Arch Linux users (cf.
https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=263360 and
https://github.com/archlinuxhardened/selinux/issues/81) and I reported
this on some kernel mailing lists a few days ago
(https://lore.kernel.org/linux-security-module/CAJfZ7=nWJisw2RRW2AvFgpYKQK_PghudeBqiTQXNfedS2idP-Q@mail.gmail.com/).
Your answer to this issue was very clear (and thank you for explaining
this):

« You can't (currently) use SELinux and BPF at the same time. This is
because the infrastructure does not support multiple secid<->secctx
translation hooks. You get the first one in the list. BPF provides all
hooks, so the SELinux hooks aren't reached and the secid to secctx
translation fails in the "bpf,selinux" case. »

Anyway, this means that using "security=..." does not work if
CONFIG_LSM contains the BPF LSM module, so no: you *cannot* select one
major module using security=, when the kernel is compiled with
CONFIG_LSM="lockdown,yama,bpf".

Backward compatibility was broken and Arch Linux users were required
to switch to lsm= in order to use AppArmor, SELinux, etc. (and the
documentation of this distribution got updated:
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AppArmor,
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SELinux, etc.).
