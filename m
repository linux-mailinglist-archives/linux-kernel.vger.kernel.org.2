No, you=E2=80=99re not reading what I said. It=E2=80=99s specified to be =
13 in the
Sscofmpf spec, there is zero need to encode information in the device
tree that is already mandated by a specification. We don=E2=80=99t put =
that
supervisor software interrupts are 1 nor that supervisor timer
interrupts are 5 in the device tree, so we also don=E2=80=99t need to =
put that
supervisor counter overflow interrupts are 13 in it. We *do* currently
put machine timer interrupt information from the CLINT in the device
tree, and both supervisor and machine external interrupt information
from the PLIC, but that is not to tell you what=E2=80=99s already =
specified
(that they=E2=80=99re interrupts 7, 11 and 9 respectively), it=E2=80=99s =
to tell you
which order the per-hart registers are in in the CLINT, and which order
the contexts are in in the PLIC. If it were up to me that would=E2=80=99ve=
 been
expressed a different way as it=E2=80=99s an ugly encoding, rather =
redundant
and not the nicest to decode in software, but it=E2=80=99s too late for =
that.
Though with the ACLINT, APLIC and other AIA parts on the horizon I hope
we can get saner bindings for those that don=E2=80=99t repeat those =
mistakes.
But the point is, if it=E2=80=99s specified by the spec, it doesn=E2=80=99=
t need to go
in the device tree, the device tree is for telling you all the things
you don=E2=80=99t, and can=E2=80=99t, already know.

Nope, it=E2=80=99s:

1. Probe PMU SBI extension
2. Register a driver
3. If Sscofmpf is present, register for interrupt 13

Or perhaps with 2 and 3 swapped.

You=E2=80=99re making this far too complicated by being fixated on =
needing
device tree in there somewhere. You don=E2=80=99t need it at all except
possibly to tell you that Sscofmpf is supported, which should be done
the same as any other supervisor extension like Svnapot or Svpbmt.
