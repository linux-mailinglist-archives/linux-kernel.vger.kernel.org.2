Sorry, that was certainly not my intention.

My understanding from the DT maintainers is that the dts would be
checked by the schema, but I suspect that you're right in that we might
have some back and forth on the DT binding, but I don't think that's a
big deal.

Yeah, I presume that someone with the documentation would need to go
through each one of these and see what kind of grouping there might be.

And I also presume that there might be cases where the CPU clocks has
moved into the secure world, so that even though the hardware block is
the same the presence of a in-kernel clock driver in the implementation
might differ.


But just to clarify, I find it annoying having to sprinkle compatibles
all over the place every time I try to get a new board up. So I am not
against us trying to figure this out.
