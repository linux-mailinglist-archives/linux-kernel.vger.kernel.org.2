On my end this doesn't let PREEMPT_DYNAMIC select PREEMPT, which I came to
realize we need (places like vermagic.h and ftrace's print_trace_header();
also it avoids a lot of headaches).

AIUI this is because the 'if <expr>' is equivalent to appending
  depends on <expr>
to every choice item.

The below lets me have PREEMPT w/ PREEMPT_DYNAMIC. The one annoying thing
is the Preemption Model prompt remains visible in menuconfig when
PREEMPT_DYNAMIC is selected, but eh...
