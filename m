No we should not. Sometimes, what's in the kernel is for the kernel's
use only, and not for userspace's use. That may be because what works
in kernel space does not work in userspace.

For example, the ARMv6+ atomic operations can be executed in userspace
_provided_ they are only used on memory which has an exclusive monitor.
They can't be used on anything that is not "normal memory". Prior to
ARMv6, the atomic operations rely on disabling interrupts. That
facility is simply not available to userspace, so these must not be
made available to userspace.

The same applies to bitops.

We've been here before in the past, when the kernel headers were not
separated from the user ABI headers, and people would write programs
that included e.g. bitops.h on x86 because they had optimised bitops
code. This made the userspace programs very non-portable - without
re-implementing userspace versions of this stuff in every userspace
program that did this stuff.

So no, having experienced the effects of this kind of thing in the
past, the kernel should _not_ export architecture specific code in
header files to userspace.

Also, it should be pointed out that by doing so, you create a licensing
issue. If the code is GPLv2, and you build your program such that it
incorporates GPLv2 code, then if the userspace program is not GPLv2
compliant, you have a licensing problem, and in effect the program
can be distributed.

Please do not go down this route.
