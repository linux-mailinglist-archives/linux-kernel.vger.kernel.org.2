Sure, but look at what ICC_RPR_EL1 does for FIQ==1:

<quote>
if HaveEL(EL3) && !IsSecure() && SCR_EL3.FIQ == '1' then
    // A Non-secure GIC access and Group 0 inaccessible to Non-secure.
        if pPriority<7> == '0' then
	    // Priority is in Secure half and not visible to Non-secure
	    Priority = Zeros();
        elsif !IsOnes(pPriority) then
	    // Non-secure access and not idle, so physical priority must be shifted
            pPriority<7:0> = (pPriority AND PRIMask())<6:0>:'0';

return ZeroExtend(pPriority);
</quote>

See how the the priority is shifted *left* (bits [6:0] end up in
[7:1])?

That's not my reading of the pseudocode.

0? Really????

You have completely lost me. This contradicts what you have written
above.

Thanks,
