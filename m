Hm yeah that's annoying. Another thing to check is that there's no locking
issues with lockdep enabled. But there's plenty of other places that
register/bind drivers within other drivers, so it should all work.

I think this is a good reason why more drivers should be converted (in
separate patches) so that we get a lot more testing and can find bugs in
the design.
