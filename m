Does it require RCU synchronization as the updates only happen from
user space. But is this for the writing of the event? You want a
separate fd for each event to write to, instead of saying you have
another interface to write and just pass the given id?

I will say, whenever we say this will only have a "few", if it becomes
useful, it will end up having many.
