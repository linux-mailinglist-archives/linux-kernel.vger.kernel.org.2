A helper could potentially be used but right now, there is only one
call-site that needs this type of care so it may be overkill. A helper
was proposed that can lookup and lock a per-cpu structure which is
generally useful but does not suit the case where different locks need
to be acquired.

I don't think PREEMPT_RT gets additional parallelism because it's still
a per-cpu structure that is being protected. The difference is whether
we are protecting the CPU-N index for all per_cpu_pages or just one.
The patch exists because it was asked why the lock was not embedded within
the structure it's protecting. I initially thought that was unsafe and
I was wrong as explained in the changelog. But now that I find it *can*
be done but it's a bit ugly so I put it at the end of the series so it
can be dropped if necessary.
