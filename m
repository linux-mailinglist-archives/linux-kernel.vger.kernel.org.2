Neither really.  'Correct' is such a difficult concept.
'Preferred' might be better.

btw: there are about another 100 other uses with '__init' as the
initial attribute, mostly in trace.

And I still think that return type attributes like __init, which is
just a __section define, should go before the function storage class
and ideally on a separate line to simplify the parsing of the actual
function declaration.  Attributes like __section, __aligned, __cold,
etc... don't have much value when looking up a function definition.

Pathological is pretty common these days as the function name length
is rather longer now than earlier times.

I would put [return type attributes] on the initial separate line
even though that's not the most common use today.

Bikeshed building dreamer...

btw:

Scouting through kernel code for frequency of use examples really
should have some age of code checking associated to the use.

Older code was far more freeform than more recently written code.

But IMO the desire here is to ask for a bit more uniformity, not
require it.
