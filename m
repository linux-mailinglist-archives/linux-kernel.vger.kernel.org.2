I wonder if PAC or BTI also make this slightly more complex?  PAC at
least has implications for unwinders, IIUC.

Sure, but this is what production unwinders do, and they don't require
compiler plugins, right?  I don't doubt unwinders can be made simpler
with changes to toolchain output; please work with your compiler
vendor on making such changes rather than relying on compiler plugins
to do so.

Right, this takes a focus on simplicity, at the cost of alienating a toolchain.

Ard's point about 3193c0836f20 relating to -fgcse is that when
presented with tricky cases to unwind, the simplest approach is taken.
There it was disabling a compiler specific compiler optimization, here
it's either a compiler specific compiler plugin (or disabling another
compiler optimization).  The pattern seems to be "Objtool isn't smart
enough" ... "compiler optimization disabled" or "compiler plugin
dependency."

Yes, I think we could spec out something like that.  But I would
appreciate revisiting open questions around stack validation (frame
pointers), preventing the generation of jump tables to begin with
(-fno-jump-tables) in place of making objtool more robust, or
generally the need to depend on compiler plugins.
