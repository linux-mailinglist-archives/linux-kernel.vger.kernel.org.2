Ok, then really, it's not a big deal :)

Your patch made them "special", don't do that.

No, that's the wrong thing to do.

No, "try" methods suck, as the Yoda quote says.

Should not be needed.

I thought about this, sorry for the confusion.

Not that I know of, all objects live on some sort of "type/bus", that's
the way the driver model works.

Live patching is vodoo magic.  But it just "adds" code paths, and later,
when it feels all is good, then it can remove stuff (if it even does,
I do not remember).  Adding is easy, removing is hard.

If any driver has that kind of crud, they deserve the nightmare that
would happen if it interacts this way.  Don't worry about that, it's not
a pattern that anyone should be using.

And again, if the code and data is still there, the lock is ok to grab,
there should not be a problem.  If so, we can fix the driver.
