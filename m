I agree that this would be a general improvement but it is not always
possible (see below).

Most of the time the cluster level scheduler pushes the information to
the node controller which transfers that information to the
oom-killer. However based on the freshness of the information the
oom-killer might request to pull the latest information (IPC and RPC).

I agree this does not have to be prctl().

I was thinking of per-task_struct instead of per-mm_struct just for simplicity.

Correct

Correct

I was thinking of any type of allocation from the oom-killer (or
specific threads). Please note that the mempool is the backup and only
used in the slowpath.

This would mean that either the estimate of mempool size is bad or
oom-killer is buggy and leaking memory.

I am open to any design directions for mempool or some other way where
we can provide a notion of memory guarantee to oom-killer.
