Your suggestion sound good to me.

The risk here is that both processors try to access this table at the same time.

Just a precision: the vring DA can be fixed by the coprocessor firmware to
impose the address, my patch is not sufficent in such case for the reattachment.
That's why i suggested a copy of the resource table before updating it.
