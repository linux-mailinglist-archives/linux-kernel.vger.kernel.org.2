In general this sounds good to me.

And make it combinable with SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_NEW_LISTENER, I like that.

A common case is will likely be to just rely the status to the
supervised task and not even perform some complicated action in the
supervisor.
So I think a way to optionally combine recv+send at the same time might
be a good idea. Either another ioctl which is a combined recv+send or a
flag on the SECCOMP_IOCTL_NOTIF_RECV_STATUS.
