My bot found errors running 'make DT_CHECKER_FLAGS=-m dt_binding_check'
on your patch (DT_CHECKER_FLAGS is new in v5.13):

yamllint warnings/errors:

dtschema/dtc warnings/errors:
/builds/robherring/linux-dt-review/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/display/panel/panel-edp.example.dt.yaml: bridge@2d: 'aux-bus' does not match any of the regexes: 'pinctrl-[0-9]+'
	From schema: /builds/robherring/linux-dt-review/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/display/bridge/ti,sn65dsi86.yaml
\ndoc reference errors (make refcheckdocs):

See https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/1511822

This check can fail if there are any dependencies. The base for a patch
series is generally the most recent rc1.

If you already ran 'make dt_binding_check' and didn't see the above
error(s), then make sure 'yamllint' is installed and dt-schema is up to
date:

pip3 install dtschema --upgrade

Please check and re-submit.
