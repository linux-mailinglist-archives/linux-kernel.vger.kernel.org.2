Yeah, I don't see how there could be issues. The for-5.14/soc does have
all the dependencies that it needs, as far as I can tell, as does the
for-5.14/memory branch. If for-5.14/soc gets pulled first, then the
sub-branch that's included in for-5.14/memory will end up in ARM SoC
before for-5.14/memory, but that should be harmless. Once
for-5.14/memory is then pulled in, it'll pull in all the dependencies
with it, except that part of them will be there already from
for-5.14/soc.

The only way this could break is if either the original series wasn't
bisectible, or if some of the later SoC patches rely on patches from the
memory portion of that, which rely on the earlier SoC patches. That'd be
a very odd circular dependency and would add to the complexity on how to
handle this. But given that all these branches seem to be building fine,
I don't think that's the case.

If something like that ever happens within a series, please make sure to
point that out. In general a good way to manage such circular
dependencies is to post subseries separately and make a note of the
dependencies in the cover letter to make that clearer. That's also why
it's usually a good idea to send series such that the patches within are
ordered by tree. That way it's trivial to find out if there are any such
circular dependencies by doing a bisectibility build on the branch.

Thierry
