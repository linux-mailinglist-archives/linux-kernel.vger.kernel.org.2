Of course, there are tons of such examples and delaying a patch for DTS
is perfectly safe, sane and regular way to deal with it.

First of all, out of tree is not our concern. Let me quote DT guru, Rob:
"If it's not upstream, it doesn't exist."
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20201028152303.GA4041470@bogus/T/#m602ef29cade6f9ed49efd52159210d2a6813eec9

Second of all, out of tree DTB (so old DTB in your meaning) will work
perfectly fine (the same) and nothing is broken. So why I would need to
care about something which "does not exist" while I also do not break
it?

If anyone takes kernel DTS and applies to his project, and then he takes
blindly the latter changes to DTS (but without earlier changes to
bindings! so he picks up only selective choice), then it's his
responsibility to be up to date. I am sorry, but I cannot take care
about any ridiculous and irresponsible idea in the world.

Seriously, do you expect us to think about out of tree unkown users of
an intree DTS when that *user does not follow bindings*?

It's the first time I hear it.

There is no single need for intree kernel DTS to be backwards compatible
with old kernel. There is no single rule for it, either (because it's
not ABI).
