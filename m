None of the patches in this series ended up on a mailing list or on
lore, so no one could comment on them, except for people CCed directly.

The driver has been accepted in tty-next, commit b61c8bf4694b5115
("tty: serial: Add UART driver for Cortina-Access platform").  From a
quick glance, it could have used some review.

The driver is using the compatible value "cortina-access,serial", so I
guess the binding patch added "cortina-access" to vendor-prefixes.yaml.
According to https://www.cortina-access.com/news-and-events, this is
the same company as Cortina Systems, which already has the "cortina"
vendor prefix.  In 2015, it was acquired by Realtek, so perhaps it
should use the "realtek" prefix instead for new development?

The SERIAL_CORTINA_ACCESS symbol doesn't depend on anything, so
it will show up on everyone's oldconfig radar soon, regardless of
building a kernel for a Cortina Access system or not.
I wanted to change it to something like:

     config SERIAL_CORTINA_ACCESS
            tristate "Cortina-Access serial port support"
    +       depends on FIXME || COMPILE_TEST
            select SERIAL_CORE
            help
              This driver is for Cortina-Access SoC's UART. If you
have a machine
              based on the Cortina-Access SoC and wish to use the serial port,
              say 'Y' here. Otherwise, say 'N'.

but given there is no evidence of patches to add support for the
CAXXXX line of SoCs, there's no symbol to depend on...
