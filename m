The bug report you are referring to is ancient. And the cpuset code
doesn't touch task->flags for a long time. I haven't checked exactly but
it is years since regular and atomic flags have been separated unless I
misremember.

I am really confused what you are proposing here TBH and referring to an
ancient bug doesn't really help. task->flags are _explicitly_ documented
to be only used for _current_. Is it possible that somebody writes a
buggy code? Sure, should we build a whole infrastructure around that to
catch such a broken code? I am not really sure. One bug 6 years ago
doesn't sound like a good reason for that.
