We can and we should.

The reason for that should be addressed IIRC.

I think those two things are just orthogonal. Bailing out from vmalloc
early sounds reasonable to me on its own. Allocating a large thing that
is likely to go away with the allocating context is just a waste of
resources and potential reason to disruptions to others.

Agreed. I do not think it is viable to sprinkle fatal_signal_pending or
similar checks all over the code. This should better be limited to
allocators and the charging function.

Our assumption that is described in the code simply doesn't hold and it
is close to impossible to check all charging paths to bail out properly
so I think we should just remove that optimistic attitude and do not
force charges unless that is absolutely necessary (e.g. __GFP_NOFAIL) or
impractical (e.g. atomic allocations) and bound.

I didn't get to review the patch yet. This is a tricky area with many
unobvious corner cases. I will try find some time next week.

Thanks!
