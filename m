That's overstating things somewhat. The vast majority of applications 
will work fine regardless (as they did before Mesa started using this 
functionality). Only some special ones will run into issues, because the 
user-space drivers incorrectly assume two file descriptors reference 
different descriptions.

Right, that (and the above) is why I considered it fair game to use. 
What should I have done instead? (TBH I was surprised that this 
functionality isn't generally available)

You're making it sound like this snuck in secretly somehow, which is not 
true of course.

Per above, not sure this is really true.
