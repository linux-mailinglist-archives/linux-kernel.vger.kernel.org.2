Sure. I have not done a complete study on which workers in our system can
compete with important tasks in other cgroups. We will have to do that to
adjust the workqueue priority so that the impact can be minimized.

yeah, not exactly what we are looking for. It gives us the abiility to restrict
the priority of all unbound workqueues at the expense of not being able to
prioritize one workqueue over another workqueue.
