So if the I/O not returning for every days, such that this thread had
been hanging for that long, it also follows that since it was calling
do_get_write_access(), that a handle was open.  And if a handle is
open, then the current jbd2 transaction would never close --- which
means none of the file system operations executed over the past few
days would never commit, and would be undone on the next reboot.
Furthermore, sooner or later the journal would run out of space, at
which point the *entire* system would be locked up waiting for the
transaction to close.

I'm guessing that if the server hadn't come to a full livelock
earlier, it's because there aren't that many metadata operations that
are happening in the server's stable state operation.  But in any
case, this particular server was/is(?) doomed, and all of the patches
that you proposed are not going to help in the long run.  The correct
fix is to fix the hypervisor, which is the root cause of the problem.

I could imagine some kind of retry counter, where we start sleeping
after some number of retries, and give up after some larger number of
retries (at which point the allocation would fail with ENOSPC).  We'd
need to do some testing against our current tests which test how we
handle running close to ENOSPC, and I'm not at all convinced it's
worth the effort in the end.  We're trying to (slightly) improve the
case where (a) the file system is running close to full, (b) the
hypervisor is critically flawed and is the real problem, and (c) the
VM is eventually doomed to fail anyway due to a transaction never
closing due to an I/O never getting acknowledged for days(!).

If you really want to fix things in the guest OS, I perhaps the
virtio_scsi driver (or whatever I/O driver you are using), should
notice when an I/O request hasn't gotten acknowledged after minutes or
hours, and do something such as force a SCSI reset (which will result
in the file system needing to be unmounted and recovered, but due to
the hypervisor bug, that was an inevitable end result anyway).

Cheers,
