So, although your idea makes sense, I do not know exactly how to implement it right now, and regardless it is likely to provide much lower performance improvements than those that avoiding full IOTLB flushes would.

I was mainly thinking that when you observe a change in "order" and sync 
to avoid over-invalidating adjacent pages, those pages may still be part 
of the current unmap and you've just not seen them added yet. Hence 
simply gathering contiguous pages regardless of alignment, then breaking 
the total range down into appropriately-aligned commands in the sync 
once you know you've seen everything, seems like it might allow issuing 
fewer commands overall. But I haven't quite grasped the alignment rules 
either, so possibly this is moot anyway.

Robin.
