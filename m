I implemented this a few years back and I think it should've made it
onto Android by default now. So that approach does indeed work well, it
seems:
https://chromium.googlesource.com/aosp/platform/system/core/+/master/rootdir/init.rc#257

This should be easier to follow than the devpts case because you don't
need to wade through the {t,p}ty layer.

Yes, sure:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20200424162052.441452-1-christian.brauner@ubuntu.com/

You can also just pull my branch. I think it's still based on v5.7 or sm:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/brauner/linux.git/log/?h=loopfs

I'm happy to collaborate on this too.

Christian
