Yes, that happens.  It's an unfortunate side-effect of the same ol'
issues repeating themselves over and over.  Mostly due to copy/paste
of mundane code segments such as function documentation.

It would have even been painful to post-process patches within the
same subsystem.  For instance, I've just finished cleaning up GPU
which was a mammoth task where most of the issues were perpetually
duplicated.

I will admit though, that here in Clock, it would be somewhat easier.

The issue I see with the Clock, is that some files are maintained by
individual driver Maintainers and others by subsystem Maintainers.  So
the post-process here is that much more painful (as it can't be
easily scripted using get_maintainer.pl) and the aforementioned
lag-time issues come into play while we wait for sleepy reviewers.

Right, I did mention that.

There are a couple of schools of thought on function documentation.
The conflicting one to yours is that Kernel-doc headers should only be
used if they are part of an API and have an accompanying kernel-doc::
tag in Documentation.  The functions touched here do not.

NB: Fortunately the functions we're discussing are all static or else
`scripts/find-unused-docs.sh` would complain about them also.

Personally, I am in the middle.  If authors have had a good go at
documenting functions and their parameters, I'll make the effort to
fix any doc-rot or oversights.  However if, like here, no such effort
has been made, they get demoted.  Nothing stopping authors fixing them
up properly and re-promoting them again though.  Essentially I'm
trying to avoid a situation where authors throw something together
half-heatedly, safe in the knowledge that someone will come fix and
beautify things for them.

> Surely we can meet half-way

I'm always happy to collaborate.  What does half-way look like?
