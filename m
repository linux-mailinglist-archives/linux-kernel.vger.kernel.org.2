Does the hardware actually care about it?  The only thing it does is
to force allocating from a specific virtual address range, but how
would that have a special meaning?

I've just tried to keep the existing attributes.  If SRMMU_PRIV does
indeed mean that the page can't also be mapped into userspace page tables
it would be good to remove it in an incremental patch.  If OTOH it only
means that this PTE is a kernel mapping it should not affect a userspace
mapping as that will always use separate PTEs.
