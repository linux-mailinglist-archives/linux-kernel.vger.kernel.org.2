Indeed.  Oddly, SGX has the exact same problem for any scenario in which
SGX is used for HSM-like functionality, and people still use SGX.

However, I suspect that there will be use cases in which exactly one VM
is permitted to use KL.  Qubes might want that (any Qubes people around?)

Indeed.  This stinks.

There could be a host configuration "guest_only", perhaps.

It lets userspace use KL with some degree of security.

The guest can use TDX.  Oh wait, TDX doesn't support KL.

That being said, a host attack on the guest of this sort would be quite
slow.

I want to see concrete guest use cases before we start adding *any*
guest support.  And this cuts both ways -- I think that, until the guest
use cases are at least somewhat worked out, Linux should certainly not
initialize KL by default on boot if the CPUID hypervisor bit is set.
