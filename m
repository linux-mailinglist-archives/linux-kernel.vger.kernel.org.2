Thanks for explaining the origin of these numbers, I had quite a
difficult time figuring out where the "magic" came from.

Right, so downstream we do all the math and then we scale the
denominator by 2x or 3x to compensate for the fact that we didn't
account for the division as the clock left the PLL.

As this was reworked upstream for some reason this compensation was
retained, so the denominator would always be 2x or 3x to large for HBR2
and HBR3. So the way this was solved was to divide by 2x or 3x before
calculating the ratio.

So what you're saying is that the reason for this obfuscation is to
replicate any rounding errors happening in the path of the link clock
generation?

If that's the case then this needs a giant comment describing exactly
what's happening and why this function needs to be impenetrable.


That said, from my attempts to write this patch (and add widebus
support) I saw a huge flexibility in getting this right, so can you
please elaborate on the value of the precision of the ratio.
