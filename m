Sorry if it wasn't clear. I was referring to the information in that
link (i.e., your commit log for the first suggested patch).

Again, this is the kind of motivation that would need to be in the
commit log. What problem are you solving in those modules that warrants
changing the semantics of sysfs_streq()? Why does that module's sysfs
interface need case-insensitive string comparison?

It's a lot easier to assess the merits of this new functionality
(whether in the form of a new separate function, or changed semantics of
sysfs_streq()) if we also see a few use cases. New functions are not
added without users. Bells and whistles are not added without users.

That's fine, but you need to include proper information on why a new
function is added or semantics of an existing one is changed (and for
the latter, some words on why you believe all existing callers would be
ok with that).
