Since I did the work for a general fix as an alternative proof of
concept to the ugliness reflected on those two last patches, I'd like
instead for Greg to re-consider merging a general fix.

Greg, can you comment on technical levels why a general core fix is not
desirable upstream for those two issues?

Based on feedback from folks, it does not seem the argument that we
don't support rmmod holds water.  Specially given we are now even
discussing using live patching to suport error injection as a strategy
to not incur more code / boiler plate code even on the block layer [0].
The live patching approach would mean for testing purposes we'd
temporarily use error injection via live patching and then remove the
module after done testing.
