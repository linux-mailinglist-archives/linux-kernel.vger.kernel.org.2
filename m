I have one more issue around snapshot mode which I'd like to check if it's
related to this patchset.

In "[PATCH v5 0/1] perf cs-etm: Split Coresight decode by aux records",
I added the warning for a missing AUXTRACE buffer as you suggested.
Now this warning gets triggered on the last AUX record when using
snapshot mode. I don't know if you are able to reproduce this.

Thanks
James
