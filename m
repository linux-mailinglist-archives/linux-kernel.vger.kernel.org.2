Looking at both of the ext2_error() calls in ext2_get_group_desc(),
those are really more in the way of assertions rather than warning of
an on-disk corruption issue.  The second "group descriptor not loaded"
should never happen, and the "block_group >= groups_count" should have
been caught via an invalid block number or check by the caller (or an
outright code bug in say ext2_statfs().

So I suspect both of those would be more usefule as a WARN() rather
than a call to ext2_error(), since stack trace would actually provide
more useful data to root causing the issue.  Jan, what do you think?

P.S.  The same analysis applies for ext4_get_group_desc(), BTW.  We
don't take a lock in ext4_statfs() so trying to take a lock while
sleeping is not an issue.

For both ext2 and ext4, the caller is not supposed to holding spin
locks when it calls ext[24]_error().  In cases where it is absolutely
not avoidable, special measures are required --- see for example
__ext4_grp_locked_error().
