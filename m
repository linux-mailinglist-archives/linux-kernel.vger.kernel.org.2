I don't want to see pwrseq (the binding) expanded to other buses. If 
that was the answer, we wouldn't be having this discussion. It was a 
mistake for MMC IMO. 

If pwrseq works as a kernel library/api, then I have no issue with that.

Power sequencing requirements are inheritently per device unless we're 
talking about standard connectors. 

This is a solved problem on MDIO. It's quite simple. If there's a DT 
node for a device you haven't discovered, then probe it anyways.
