I'm thinking we can pass the descriptor to the event and not have it record
it. We could add a new field type for defining the event. Something like:

	__filter_field()

that has size zero in the event itself, but is available to the filtering
logic. Than perhaps we could pass that descriptor to the filter that has
all the information needed.

	DEFINE_DYNAMIC_DEBUG_METADATA(descriptor, width);
	log_read_mmio(width, addr, descriptor);

Where descriptor is NULL when dynamic debug in disabled.

Have a way to pass that descriptor to the filtering logic (I'll have to
take a look into it) and then be able to use the normal filtering.

This way you could also create multiple instances, where one instance
records the events coming from one file, and the other records events from
another file, and not have just one big switch that disables all calls to
log_read_mmio().
