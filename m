Yes, storing idx in loc_track seems straight-forward, and should also
improve code readability.

Patch will follow right here. I made idx a loff_t, as it seemed easier to
handle in op->start/next, then casted to unsigned long again in op->show.
Not sure if the unsigned int had any benefit. Given that loff_t is a signed
64 bit type, I guess both are wrong if it should ever turn negative (can it,
i.e. can ppos turn negative?). With unsigned long, chances are better that
it will at least turn into something big enough to not pass the
"idx < t->count" check.

Maybe we are just holding it wrong :-)
