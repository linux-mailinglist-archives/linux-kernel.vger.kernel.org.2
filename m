Fair enough.
I suppose it would be too much churn to move gigabyte-wmi to
hwmon now though, correct?

Having the platform-driver-x86 on Cc would still be useful as they can provide
guidance about using the ACPI/WMI/platform APIs.

For example by using the WMI bus as mentioned in my other mail would allow
to completely remove the manually maintained DMI list and instead directly bind
to the WMI GUID for any device that supports this GUID.
(This is possible as this WMI API seems to be self-describing, so all
specific parameters can be discovered by the driver)
