According to the HW engineers, the RTL implementation has not changed; it is
the same as the RTL in the current PAC products. Polling for HW to clear the
ACK is something we could have (should have?) been doing all along. The timing
hasn't been an issue for the current PAC products, as proven by our testing.
However, with OFS we cannot anticipate what the timing will be for customer
designed products, so the specification is calling out this requirement as a
precaution.

I am using a development machine that has the older PAC devices installed. I
cleared port errors on these cards as a quick check, and the reset completes
without hanging - which indicates that the ACK bit is in fact getting cleared.
So there is not need for any device-specific conditional statements here.
