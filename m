On a Beaglebone Black based system with some of the UARTs enabled, those
keep their numbers such that e.g. ttyS0, ttyS1, and ttyS4 show up in
/dev while ttyS2 and ttyS3 do not since they don't correspond to any
(enabled) ports.

If any of the very many variants of this driver do not assign fixed
numbers, those would possibly be renumbered.  Should that be the case,
the numbering was never guaranteed to begin with, so I fail to see any
problem.
