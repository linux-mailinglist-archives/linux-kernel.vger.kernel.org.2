Yes, it's doing another check which is useful in terms of early
detection of bugs when a developer has the code open for
modifications.  It slows down performance under normal circumstances,
and assuming the code is bug-free(tm), it's entirely unnecessary ---
which is why it's under an "if (0)".

However, if there *is* a bug, having an early detection that the
representation invariant of the data structure has been violated can
be useful in root causing a bug.  This would probably be clearer if
the code was pulled out into a separate function with comments
explaining that this is a rep invariant check.

The main thing about DX_DEBUG right now is that it is **super**
verbose.  Unwary users who enable it.... will be sorry.  If we want to
make it to be a first-class feature enabled via CONFIG_EXT4_DEBUG, we
should convert all of the dx_trace calls to use pr_debug so they are
enabled only if dynamic debug enables those pr_debug() statements.
And this should absolutely be a separate patch.

Cheers,
