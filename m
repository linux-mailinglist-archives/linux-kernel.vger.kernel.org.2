The problem with not re-sending the sigint is that if you want to run the
script in a bash while loop like:

  while ! tests/shell/test_arm_coresight.sh; do echo loop; done

Then it's impossible to exit with Ctrl-C and delete the temp files at the
same time. It exits if we don't trap sigint like it is at the moment, but
then it leaves the temporary files. This change is so we can have both
behaviours of Ctrl-C in a loop and keep the cleanup working.
