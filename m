Thank you Rafael for all these information. We will have to re-visit
many places on our platform and how this boost should work. It looks
for the first glance that its a full-time task for one of our
team members. We would have to organize this investigation
internally to get better understanding of all affected places.

While this patch change is easy, since the policy->max should
contain the nominal max freq at this setup time (which is what
we want for calculating capacity), the schedutil usage of
cpuinfo.max_freq is not easy to judge and solve. Currently,
on our platforms we stick to the design where nominal max freq
is 1024 capacity, but I don't know if that would hold for long...
