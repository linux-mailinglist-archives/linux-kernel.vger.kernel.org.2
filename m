Hi,

Awesome, thanks a lot for the detailed review!

Sure, DART should only be an iommu.

The hint to look at arm-smmu for a similar flow was very helpful, thanks!
Now that I understand how these groups works I completely agree that this
needs to be reworked and done properly.

There are two (very similar) types of DARTs.
The one supported with this series has up to 16 stream ids which will be
integers <16. There's another variant used for Thunderbolt for which I will
add support in a follow-up that supports up to 64 stream ids then. 
So at worst this is an array with 64 entries if this structure won't
disappear completely.

And yes, this is conceptually a bit like arm-smmu's stream indexing I think.

Yup, removed.

The problem is that these streams may come from two different
DART instances. That is required for e.g. the dwc3 controller which
has a weird quirk where DMA transactions go through two separate
DARTs with no clear pattern (e.g. some xhci control structures use the
first dart while other structures use the second one).
Both of them need to point to the same pagetable.
In the device tree the node will have an entry like this:

dwc3_0: usb@382280000{
   ...
   iommus = <&dwc3_0_dart_0 0>, <&dwc3_0_dart_1 1>;
};

There's no need for a linked list though once I do this properly with
groups. I can just use an array allocated when the first device is
attached, which just contains apple_dart* and streamid values.

I'd be happy to use the fwspec code if that's somehow possible.
I'm not sure how though since I need to store both the reference to the DART
_and_ to the stream id. As far as I can tell the fwspec code would only allow
to store the stream ids.
(see also the previous comment regarding the dwc3 node which requires stream
ids from two separate DART instances)

I'll just use DL_FLAG_AUTOREMOVE_SUPPLIER. No idea why I went for stateless links.

Yes, it's just 0,1,2,3...,0xe,0xf but I can't do 8bit writes to the bus
and 32 bit writes then require these slightly awkward "swapped" numbers.
I'll add a comment since it's not obvious at first glance.

No, this can't happen. I'll remove it.

True, and with the patch you sent I don't need this here either way.

I'll see if that's possible. So essentially I want to setup an identity
mapping with respect to bus_dma_region from the first attached device.
Right now this is always mapping the entire 4G VA space to RAM
starting at 0x8_0000_0000. 
See also my reply to another comment further down since software
bypass mode might have to disappear anyway.

Makes sense, will remove that WARN (and other below as well).

Some background: the PCIe DART only supports a 32bit VA space but RAM
on these machines starts at 0x8_0000_0000. I have something like 
  dma-ranges = <0x42000000 0 0 0x8 0 0 0xffff0000>;
in the pcie nodes to add that offset to dma addresses.

What I want to do here then is to setup an identity mapping with respect
to the DMA layer understanding of addresses encoded in bus_dma_region.
Now this will always just be a constant offset of 0x8_0000_0000 for
all M1s but I didn't want to hardcode that.
The code here is just there to guard against a situation where someone
somehow manages to attach two devices with different offsets to the same
domain.

If that's not how the abstraction is supposed to work and/or too big of a hack
I'll just remove the software bypass mode altogether.
PCIe won't work on 4k kernels then but the only people using this so far 
build their own kernels with patches either way and won't complain.
And by the time Linux will actually be useful for "normal" setups
the dma-iommu layer can hopefully just handle a larger page granularity.

Probably, but I'll first see if I can just refactor it away.

Okay, I'll go through the code paths again, get rid of these warnings and
make sure I don't check the same thing more than once.

Hah! Just because I'm curious: What is that new domain type going to be? :)

True, will remove it.

Ah, makes sense. I'll remove the warning!

I can get rid of the links, but I'll still need some way to store
both the apple_dart and the sid here. Like mentioned above, I'll
be happy to reuse the fwspec code but I don't see how yet.

Okay, this is very good to know. Thanks again for the pointer to the
arm-smmu code, it really helped me understand how iommu_groups are
supposed to work. I'll do this the proper way for v5, which should also
simplify this driver :-)

I'll double check and either add a comment that there's a precedence or

Probably a leftover from when I just had the MEM resource.

Good point, will move it further above.

Good catch, I didn't even think about that situation.
"Luckily" the clocks are usually shared with the master device(s) attached to
the iommu, so they are already on long before apple_dart_probe is called.

Okay, will take a look and see if I can offload it and otherwise manage it
manually then.

Er, yes, I will fix this code here by doing something similar to what
arm-smmu does:

        if (!iommu_present(&platform_bus_type)) {
                ret = bus_set_iommu(&platform_bus_type, &apple_dart_iommu_ops);
                if (ret)
                        goto err_clk_disable;
        }
#ifdef CONFIG_PCI
        if (!iommu_present(&pci_bus_type)) {
                ret = bus_set_iommu(&pci_bus_type, &apple_dart_iommu_ops);
                if (ret)
                        goto err_reset_platform_ops;
        }
#endif

ugh, good catch. will clean them up as well.

True :-)

Ugh, yeah. I'll fix that as well. I'll have to see how to make this work
correctly with multiple DART instances. I guess I should only remove the
bus ops once the last one is removed. Now that I think about it, this
could also get tricky in the cleanup paths of apple_dart_probe.

Maybe just add a module_init that sets up the bus ops when it finds at
least one DART node and module_exit to tear them down again?

Makes sense, I'll see if I can put the DARTs back into a sane state
for whatever the next payload is here then.
