I guess the first thing we should look into is increasing MAX_ORDER and leaving pageblock_order and section size as is -- finding out what we have to tweak to get that up and running. Once we have that in place, we can actually look into better fragmentation avoidance etc. One step at a time.

The current handling in alloc_contig_range() is far from optimal as we have to isolate a whole MAX_ORDER - 1 page -- and on ZONE_NORMAL we'll fail easily if any part contains something unmovable although we don't even want to allocate that part. I actually have that on my list (to be able to fully support pageblock_order instead of MAX_ORDER -1 chunks in virtio-mem), however didn't have time to look into it.

Right, for will-it-scale it looks like there are mostly minor 
differences, although I am not sure if the results are really stable 
(reaching from -6% to +6%). For vm-scalability the numbers seem to vary 
even more (e.g., stddev of Â± 63%), so I have no idea how expressive they 
are. But I guess for these benchmarks, the net change won't really be 
significant.

Thanks!
