The receivers perform cleanup work similar to normal unbind. Drain/Abort
PASID. Locking is an issue in that the atomic notifier is under IOASID
spinlock, so I provided a common ordered workqueue to let mdev drivers
queue cleanup work that cannot be done in atomic context. Not ideal. Also
need to prevent nested notifications for certain cases.

Agreed.

The ordering problem as I understood is that it is difficult for KVM to
rendezvous all vCPUs before updating PASID translation table. So there
could be in-flight enqcmd with the stale PASID after the PASID table update
and refcount drop.

If KVM is the last one to drop the PASID refcount, the PASID could be
immediately reused and starts a new life. The in-flight enqcmd with the
stale PASID could cause problems. The likelihood and window is very small.

If we ensure KVM does PASID table update before IOMMU and mdev driver, the
stale PASID in the in-flight enqcmd would be be drained before starting
a new life.

Perhaps Yi and Kevin can explain this better.

I agree, this simplify things a lot. Just need to clarify the in-flight
enqcmd case.
