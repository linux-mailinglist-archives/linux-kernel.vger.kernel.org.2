Greetings,

I know that this mail will come to you as a surprise as we have never
met before, but never mind I have decided to seek confidential
cooperation with you for the execution of the deal described here
under for our mutual benefit. I hope you will keep it a secret due to
the nature of the transaction. During the course of our audit, I
discovered an unclaimed/abandoned fund totaling US$11.3 million in a
bank account that belongs to our customer who unfortunately lost his
life and entire family in a plane crash.

Now our bank has been waiting for any of the relatives to come-up for
the claim but nobody has done that. I personally has been unsuccessful
in locating any of the relatives, now, I sincerely seek your consent
to present you as the next of kin / Will Beneficiary to the deceased
so that the proceeds of this account valued at {US$11.3 Million United
State Dollars} can be paid to you, which we will share in these
percentages ratio, 60% for me and 40% for you. All I request is your
utmost sincere co- operation; trust and maximum confidentiality to
achieve this project successfully. I have carefully mapped out the
moralities for execution of this transaction under a legitimate
arrangement to protect you from any breach of the law both in your
country and here in my country when the fund is being transferred to
your bank account.

I will have to provide the entire relevant document that will be
requested to indicate that you are the rightful beneficiary of this
legacy and our bank will release the fund to you without any further
delay, upon your consideration and acceptance of this offer, please
send me the following information as stated below;

Your full name:
Country:
Address:
Occupation:
Age:
Mobile phone number:

Upon receipt of the above-mentioned information, i will send to you a
letter of application which you will send to the Head Administrative
Department of our Bank, for the release of the fund.

Best regards,
Mr.Michel Duku
