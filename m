Hrm, but the reset call itself might conflict with the inflight reset
work?  I haven't see any work canceling or flushing, so...

Tiny ALSA should work, too.  Actually there are only few drivers that
have the full PCM resume.  The majority of drivers are without the
resume support (including a large one like HD-audio).

And, with the resume implementation, I'm worried by the style like:

... and this is rather what the core code should do, and it's exactly
the same procedure that would be done without RESUME flag.
