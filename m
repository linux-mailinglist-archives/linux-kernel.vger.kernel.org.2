Apple system-on-chips have their display behind an IOMMU. Actually, a
separate IOMMU for each display, and a separate IOMMU for each display
controller -- so there are 4 IOMMUs total for display on the M1.

I've tested this patch against my work-in-progress display driver for
the M1. It indeed fixes the annoying warnings every frame (wayland) and
on mode setting (x11). So this is

	Tested-by: Alyssa Rosenzweig <alyssa@rosenzweig.io>

I've cherry-picked the patch into my M1 staging/downstream tree, so I
guess that's an Acked-by. I don't know anything about the vm_* stuff in
the kernel yet, though, since can't give a reviewed-by. Will leave that
one to the pro's.

I know you were trying to fix an HDLCD issue, but I needed this patch
too, so thank you! ðŸ˜„
