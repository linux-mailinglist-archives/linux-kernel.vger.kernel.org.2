I didn't imply that it should, I just questioning wether we should
blindly trust the DT (and that would mean someone, i.e. u-boot
have to dynamically patch it) or we we shouldn't trust it and the
kernel should figure it out on its own (this patch).

Do you know if there are any drivers in linux doing the latter?

And this is exactly what I'm worried about (or lets say unsure).
Whether we shouldn't trust the DT.

But isn't the contract the device tree?

Yes, and I disagree how this is implemented in u-boot right now (or is
proposed) because its yet again the simple and fast solution. I still
think this should be done at runtime and the node should be disabled if
it looks like its not available. that is, it should do the same as you
are doing here. If there is some software in S world taking over the
JR sometime later, then the code in u-boot has to be revised (or the
device tree for this particular board has to be adapted).

with derivatives you mean SoCs implementing CAAM? I thought of something
along the following:

ofnode_foreach_compatible_node(node, "fsl,sec-v4.0-job-ring") {
     if (caam_jr_is_unavailable())
         ofnode_set_enabled(node, false);
}

in the common dt_fixup for the SoC. So yes, this should be called for
all the SoCs which could have a CAAM. And it should also probably be
done for the control DT in u-boot.

I can't follow you here.

I still have to look at v5. but the one mail I got didn't look very
promising, as it says "we go with the "-u-boot.dtsi" approach
and just one jobring statically.
