Hi All,

We are currently working on a solution to fix the issues raised in
"Add #VE support for TDX guest" patch. While we fix that issue, I would
like to know if there are issues in other patches in this series. So if
possible can you please review other patches in the series and let us
know your comments?.

If you want me to rebase the series on top of v5.12-rcX kernel and repost it,
please let me know.
