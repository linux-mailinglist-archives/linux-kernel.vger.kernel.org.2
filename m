I would be still careful about backporting to stable trees. At least
wait for a release cycle to catch potential problems before backporting.
The problem with kmem is documented and for quite a lot of time and we
haven't received a single bug report IIRC so this is likely not a real
problem people are facing out there.

I think this is the right thing to do. Hopefuly we won't find some
tricky code which would depend on this behavior. If this turns out to be
the case then we will clearly learn about it by the kernel message and
we can to handle that situation more gracefully.

Maybe we will want to update the chengelog to be more specific based on
the review comments but this one should describe the problem quite well
already.
