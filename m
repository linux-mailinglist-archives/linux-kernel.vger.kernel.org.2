Subject: [RFC PATCH v3] perf cs-etm: Split Coresight decode by aux records
Date:   Thu, 27 May 2021 13:42:34 +0300

Populate the auxtrace queues using AUX records rather than whole
auxtrace buffers.

This is similar to the auxtrace_queues__process_index() ->
auxtrace_queues__add_indexed_event() flow where
perf_session__peek_event() is used to read AUXTRACE events out of random
positions in the file based on the auxtrace index.

Now there is a second pass using perf_session__peek_events() which loops
over all PERF_RECORD_AUX events, finds the corresponding auxtrace
buffer, and adds a fragment of that buffer to the auxtrace queues,
rather than the whole buffer.

This is a completely new implementation compared to v1 and v2 of the
patchset where significant modifications were made to the decoding flow,
including saving all of the AUX records, and changing the point where
decoding started. These changes had effects on the outcome of decoding,
but with this implementation, the output of decoding is identical to
perf/core, except in the case where decoding failed due to the issue
that this change addresses. No changes to decoding were made, apart
from populating the auxtrace queues.

Because the decoder is already reset between each auxtrace buffer,
populating the queues with fragments of whole buffers based on AUX
records has the same affect as resetting the decoder on the AUX record
bounds during decode. But this approach only requires a change to one
part of the whole flow, rather than many parts.

There is still one TODO about how buffers are found. Currently there is
a plain loop as a search, but this could be improved with a binary
search or keeping a record of which buffers have already been added and
starting the search from the last used place. AUX records and buffers
will come in similar orders in the file so the latter would be simpler
and probably be good enough. But I'm looking for feedback about the
approach as a whole before ironing out all of the details.

Other issues that were fixed by the previous patchsets such as fixing
the case where the first aux record comes before the first MMAP record
can now be fixed as completely independent issues.

Testing
=======

Testing was done with the following script, to diff the decoding results
between the patched and un-patched versions of perf:

	#!/bin/bash
	set -ex

	$1 script -i $3 $4 > split.script
	$2 script -i $3 $4 > default.script

	diff split.script default.script | head -n 20

And it was run like this, with various itrace options depending on the
quantity of synthesised events:

	compare.sh ./perf-patched ./perf-default perf-per-cpu-2-threads.data --itrace=i100000ns

No changes in output were observed in the following scenarios:

* Simple per-cpu
	perf record -e cs_etm/@tmc_etr0/u top

* Per-thread, single thread
	perf record -e cs_etm/@tmc_etr0/u --per-thread ./threads_C

* Per-thread multiple threads (but only one thread collected data):
	perf record -e cs_etm/@tmc_etr0/u --per-thread --pid 4596,4597

* Per-thread multiple threads (both threads collected data):
	perf record -e cs_etm/@tmc_etr0/u --per-thread --pid 4596,4597

* Per-cpu explicit threads:
	perf record -e cs_etm/@tmc_etr0/u --pid 853,854

* System-wide (per-cpu):
    perf record -e cs_etm/@tmc_etr0/u -a

* No data collected (no aux buffers)
	Can happen with any command when run for a short period

* Containing truncated records
	Can happen with any command

* Containing aux records with 0 size
	Can happen with any command

Snapshot mode still needs to be tested.
