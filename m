Subject: [PATCH V5 00/11] Add PMIC DT files for sc7280
Date:   Tue, 25 May 2021 15:40:55 +0530
Message-Id: <1621937466-1502-1-git-send-email-skakit@codeaurora.org>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.7.4

This series depends on https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-arm-msm/list/?series=478225
which adds therml-zones node.

Changes in V2:
 - As per Matthias comments:
   - I've Split the patch into per-PMIC patches and one sc7280 patch
   - Removed 2nd critical point, thermal-governer property
   - s/pm8325_tz/pm7325_temp_alarm and s/pm7325_temp_alarm/pm7325_thermal
   - Fixed few other minor errors.

 - As per Bjorn's comments, replaced '_' with '-' in node names and moved
   DT files inclusion to board dts.

Changes in V3:
  - As per Matthias comments, changed commit text, modified critical interrupt
    node name like <name>-crit for all pmics.
  - Moved pmk8350_vadc channel nodes to idp dts, as it is not guaranteed that
    a board with the pmk8350 will always have the other 3 PMICs

Changes in V4:
 - PMR735A and PM8350C PMICS are used in sm8350 SoC. Added thermal_zones label
   for thermal-zones node to avoid compilation error while using the phandle
   in pmic dt files.
 - As per Matthias comments:
  - Changed commit text for pmk8350 pmic patch
  - Moved the header files inclusion for the on die tempertures of PMICs from
    pmk8350 dt file to sc7280-idp dts
  - Changed commit text and made a dedicated patch to include pmic dt files
    for sc7280-idp
  - Made separate patches for on die temp channel nodes and for adding thermal-
    zones node in sc7280 SoC dtsi
