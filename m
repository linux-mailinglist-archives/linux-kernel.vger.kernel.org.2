I don't see any obvious issues with this latest version.  I assume you've tested
it on real hardware?

If it's needed despite my Co-developed-by, feel free to add:

It might be helpful if there was a brief comment here that explained that this
field is only set temporarily while the table is being set up, and it gets set
to NULL after the capabilities have been transferred to the request_queue.
I.e., it's not something that stays around here while the dm device is active.

This doesn't "return" the keyslot manager anymore, but rather assigns it to
t->ksm.  It would also be helpful if the comment explicitly mentioned that the
goal is to find the capabilities that all the devices have in common.

E.g. "Initializes t->ksm with a keyslot manager that represents the common set
of crypto capabilities of the devices described by the dm_table.".

The above comment isn't very useful :-)
