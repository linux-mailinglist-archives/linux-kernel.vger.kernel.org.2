I am a bit disappointed that nobody took up the work on bt3wire.c so that we can have a clean serdev based driver for 3-Wire / H:5 support. That would make supporting USB and UART vendor setups from the same manufacturer a lot easier.

The consistent hci_h5.c hacking is not doing anybody any favor in the long run. It will get more and more complicated especially since the underlying core design is a line discipline. This is a hint with a massively large hammer.

Marcel
