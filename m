Looks good to me. Just one small comment below. With that addressed feel
free to add:

Do we really need to queue the work here? The filesystem should be
quiescent by now, we take care to queue the work whenever we add item to
empty list. So it should be enough to have flush_work() here and then
possibly

	WARN_ON_ONCE(!list_empty(&sbi->s_discard_list))

Or am I missing something?
