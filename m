Ok, before submitting any new revision of this patch I should probably
clean this up.  I can submit a patch to change the format to what Xiubo is
proposing.  Obviously, that patch will also need to document what all
those fields actually mean.

Alternatively, the metrics file could be changed into a directory and have
4 different files, one per each section:

  metrics/
   |- files <-- not sure how to name the 1st section
   |- latency
   |- size
   \- caps

Each of these files would then have the header but, since it's a single
header, parsing it in a script would be pretty easy.  The advantage is
that this would be self-documented (with filenames and headers).
