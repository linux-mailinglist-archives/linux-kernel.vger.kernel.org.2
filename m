So what we aimed for with i915 and discrete gpu is to first align on
locking with dma_resv_lock for all buffer state, plus a bunch of
lru/allocator locks for lists and stuff.

And then with more aligned locking, figure out how to maybe share more
code.

The trouble is that right now neither shmem helpers, nor drivers using
them, are really using dma_resv_lock to protect their per-buffer state.

So yeah it's a bit an awkward situation, and I don't know myself really
how to get out of it. Lack of people with tons of free time doesn't help
much.

So best case I think is that every time we touch helpers or drivers
locking in a big way, we check whether it's at least slightly going
towards dma_resv_lock or not. And at least make sure we're not going
backwards, and maybe not spin wheels at standstill.

I guess my question is, what would be good to have to make sure we at
least all agree on the overall direction?
