Oh, good point, this is during reboot... I somehow missed it. I saw that the
kernel oopses when invalid console driver is specified and that sounded
familiar.

So these cases still _can have_ same root cause, but not necessarily.

And may I ask, just in case, if James can revert a revert of Petr's commit:

       revert a91bd6223ecd46addc71ee6fcd432206d39365d2

boot with wrong console argument and see if the kernel reboots without
any problems.
