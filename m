I have a tree with fixes for anything that has hit on arm, arm64 or x86.
There are many reasons why some patch never made it in, but usually
it's because I was not persistent about resending the fix when the first
version didn't make it. In other cases I wasn't sure about my own fix.

arc is the same as sparc here, but everything else uses unsigned long.
We've come a long way in making all those helper functions consistent
in their types, but there are still a number of exceptions.

Agreed. I added a couple of architectures to the #ifdef check over time,
but realistically this driver is only ever used on x86-32 anyway, and
we don't even care about the others here.

If we remove the #else path here, I'd make it "depends on ISA ||
COMPILE_TEST".

This one is worse, I think this is the same warning as the one I
reported as a false-positive in
https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3D99673
and https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3D99578

I submitted a patch in
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20210322160253.4032422-6-arnd@kernel.org/

To summarize the problems:

- gcc and clang have different approaches to this type of warning: clang
  tries to only produce diagnostics that are 100% reproducible regardless
  of compiler internals, while gcc tries to use as much information as it h=
as
  to warn about things that may go wrong, including things that it only kno=
ws
  because of inlining. Making this warning reliable is a variation of the
  halting problem, just like the -Wmaybe-uninitialized warnings. The diagno=
stic
  is definitely helpful and I found real bugs because of it, but you can ne=
ver
  be sure that you have found all instances.

- Some of the -Wstringop-overread warnings (and related ones) from gcc are
  actually wrong, because the object size is just a heuristic. If you
have multiple
  overlapping fixed-length fields in a union, gcc-11 picks one of the union
  members to determine the size of the string buffer within the structure, =
even
  when the string operation uses a different union member as the output, an=
d
  that member has the correct size.
  This is also a common problem: when a new warning option gets introduced
  first, there are false positives that get fixed in subsequent
compiler versions.


> alpha.log:arch/alpha/kernel/setup.c:493:13: error: 'strcmp' reading 1 or =
more bytes from a region of size 0 [-Werror=3Dstringop-overread]

I sent a couple of fixes for these: this is another false-postive bug
in gcc that made it
into the release, and it triggers on every architecture that accesses
the boot parameters
at a fixed pointer. The problem is that gcc treats '(void *)0x12345'
the same as 'NULL +
0x12345', and decides that this is an invalid NULL pointer access, so
the array has
zero readable bytes.

Surely an alpha specific mistake, though we could fix all those
drivers to drop the
'volatile'.

Nobody tests ISA drivers on 64-bit architectures...

My fix is in the network tree.

A fix was submitted today, we get at least a dozen of those for each
kernel release, and there
is a plan for avoiding them altogether, but it's a giant treewide
change that nobody has managed
to tackle.

This is add_random_kstack_offset(). No idea why it doesn't trigger on
x86, but that
warning should probably get shut up inside of the macro.
