This issue is still present and it got bisected yet again
yesterday by KernelCI.

Could you please take a look at Heiko's suggestion above to see
if this should be solved in dtbs_check?  If not then we would
need to change the KernelCI test definition to look for a
different name based on the kernel version (which sounds like
breaking user-space).

Thanks,
Guillaume
