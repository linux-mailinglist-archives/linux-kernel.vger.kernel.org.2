{sigh}

I'm not trying to argue that, no.

What I am arguing is that the complexity that the original patch was
not worth the low probablity of this actually being an issue hit in
real-life operations.

That's all, messing around with sysfs entries and module reference
counts is tricky and complex and a total mess.  We have a separation
between normal sysfs files and devices being removed that should handle
the normal operations but there are still some crazy corner cases, of
which this seems to be one.

Module removal is not a "normal" operation that can be triggered by a
system automatically without a user asking for it.  As someone reminded
me on IRC, we used to do this "automatically" for many problematic
drivers years ago for suspend/resume, that should all now be long fixed
up.

So to add crazy complexity to the kernel, for an operation that can only
be triggered manually by a root user, is not worth it in my opinion, as
the maintainer of that code the complexity was asked to be made to.

My throw-away comment of "module unloading is not supported" was an
attempt to summarize all of the above into one single sentence that
seems to have struck a nerve with a lot of people, and I appologize for
that :(

thanks,
