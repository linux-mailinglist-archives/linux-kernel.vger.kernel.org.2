I will fix it next version.

I will include it.

Initially we have used "0" as vendor ID for KVM. But Isaku proposed a new
value for it and sent a patch to fix it. But, I did not want to carry it as
separate patch (for one line change). So I have merged his change with
this patch, and added his signed-off with comment ([Isaku: proposed KVM VENDOR string])

+#define TDVMCALL_VENDOR_KVM            0x4d564b2e584454 /* "TDX.KVM" */

If it is the preferred approach, I can remove it.

Yes. For longer config names, common indentation is not maintained. Please
check the PMEM example.

Will add it.

     Since KVM hypercall functions can be included and called
     from kernel modules, export tdx_kvm_hypercall*() functions
     to avoid symbol errors
