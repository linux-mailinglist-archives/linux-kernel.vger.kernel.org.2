Looking at this I can see that the assertion is 

BUG_ON(bh->b_blocknr != invalid_block);

and I suspect it is some kind of a race between ext4_da_map_blocks() and
writeback code? Writeback code holds only i_data_sem and page locks but
ext4_da_map_blocks() holds only page lock at that point. So page lock on
that particular page is the only thing that protects us from getting
outright out of date info from extent status tree. And I'm not sure all
extent status tree manipulations are careful enough to be also protected by
page locks of all pages that are inside given extent...
