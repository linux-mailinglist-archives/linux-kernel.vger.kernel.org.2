Even with the unsafe flags, I think the callsites still needs
the undersized check at least. It may have the maxsize and minsize
for the events. If the event defined with dynamic data
(__data_loc/__rel_loc), minsize is the sum of the field size and
maxsize will be the PAGE_SIZE (or smaller than that). If the event
has no dynamic data field, minsize == maxsize.
