Then FPGA manager driver, one of Intel service layer driver's client, can decide whether to handle the newly added bitstream authentication function based on the retrieved firmware version. So that we can maintain FPGA manager driver the back compatible.

I'm not generally against using device tree, it has its place. To
describe hardware (and hardware *changes* with overlays) :)

What I don't like about this particular implementation w.r.t device-tree
usage is that it uses DT overlays as a mechanism to program the flash --
in place of having an API to do so.

One could add device-nodes during the DT overlay application, while the
FPGA doesn't actually get programmed with a new runtime image -- meaning
live DT and actual hardware state diverged -- worst case it'd crash.

So when roughly at the same time (from the same company even) we have two
patchsets that do similar things with radically different APIs I think
we should pause, and reflect on whether we can come up with something
that works for both :)

TL;DR the firmware parts to authenticate the bitstream look fine to me, the
way we tie it into the FPGA region I'm not a fan of.
