Yes it can be discarded. In fact, when filtering is enabled, it tries to
first use a temporary per cpu buffer to do the filtering and not write it
into the ring buffer. Only when it passes the filter does it get injected.

For user events that happen in user context, it will always use this temp
buffer. But since there's only buffer per CPU, if an interrupt comes in and
executes a filtered event, it will use the ring buffer itself, and discard
it if it does not match.

OK, then it probably isn't an issue to add checks to the parsing of the
dynamic arrays (including strings) that makes sure the string is within
bounds for the filtering.
