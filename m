Subject: [PATCH v11 00/29] x86: Support Intel Advanced Matrix Extensions
Date:   Fri,  1 Oct 2021 15:36:59 -0700
Message-Id: <20211001223728.9309-1-chang.seok.bae@intel.com>

Intel Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX)[1][2] will be shipping on servers
soon (Intel Sapphire Rapids).  AMX consists of configurable TMM "TILE"
registers plus new CPU instructions that operate on them.  TMUL (Tile
matrix MULtiply) is the first operator to take advantage of the new
registers, and we anticipate additional instructions in the future.

Neither AMX state nor TMUL instructions depend on AVX.  However, AMX and
AVX do share common challenges.  The TMM registers are 8KB today, and
architecturally as large as 64KB, which merit updates to hardware and
software state management.

Further, both technologies run faster when they are not simultaneously
running on SMT siblings, and both technologies use of power and bandwidth
impact the power and performance available to neighboring cores.  (This
impact has measurably improved in recent hardware.)

If the existing kernel approach for managing XSAVE state was employed to
handle AMX, 8KB space would be added to every task, but possibly rarely
used.  Thus, Linux implements on-demand expansion of per-task context
switch buffers using an XSAVE feature: eXtended Feature Disabling (XFD).
The kernel arms XFD to provide an #NM exception upon a tasks' first access
to TILE state. The kernel exception handler allocates and installs the
appropriate XSAVE context switch buffer.  User space is unaware of the
kernel's contexts switch buffer optimization.

AMX is accessible only to applications that invoke a new system call to
request access.  When a user invokes this system call, they agree that if
they use an alternate signal stack, that they are providing an alternative
signal stack of sufficient size.  The simplest way to do that is to use the
updated ABI in glibc 2.34 or later [8][9], though they could Also use their
own calculation or ask the kernel directly [3].

The patches are built on top of the recent upstream x86 FPU changes [13].

This series has three parts:
* Patch 01-16: Foundation to support dynamic user states
* Patch 17-22: AMX enablement
* Patch 23-29: Additional supplementary changes for optimization, test,
  debug and new syscalls.

Note that the per-process system call in PATCH14 reflects the latest
discussion on LKML, [10][12].

The following points summarize the latest discussion, and this
implementation:

1. Kernel sets XCR0.AMX=1 at boot, and leaves it set, always.

    XCR0 is NOT context switched by Linux.
    (If it were, every change would provoke VMEXIT if in VM.)

    (KVM context switches XCR0.   If KVM exports XFD for use by a guest OS,
    it must also context switch XFD.  KVM can not use XFD for its own
    purposes.)

2. Kernel arms XFD for all tasks.

    XFD is context switched per Linux task.

3. Apps invoke new system call to request feature access (AMX).

    Implemented as a flag to arch_prctl(2), permission granted to any task
    will grant that permission to all tasks in the process.

    It is sufficient to invoke this syscall at process or library
    init-time.

    There is no concept of removing or revoking permission, once granted to
    a process.  (Permission is cleared upon exec of a new process.)

    There is a companion system call to return the current permission.

    Analogous to AVX-512 and other stateful features, applications probe
    for AMX support by checking CPUID for the instructions and checking
    XGETBV(XCR0) for the OS support.

    However, stateful features from AMX onward also require the system call
    above to be invoked before tasks in that process may use the feature.

4. Applications touching AMX without permission results in process exit.

    Armed XFD results in #NM, results in SIGILL with si_code ILL_ILLOPC,
    typically resulting in process exit.

5. Applications touching AMX with permission allocate context switch buffer
   on-demand.

    Armed XFD results in #NM.
    Kernel allocates large context switch kernel buffer.
    Kernel dis-arms XFD for that task.

6. NM handler allocation failure results in process exit.

    If the #NM handler can not allocate the 8KB buffer, the task will
    receive a SIGILL with si_code ILL_ILLOPC at the instruction that took
    the #NM fault, typically resulting in process exit.

7. Legacy app signal stack XSTATE support includes AVX-512, and stops
   before AMX.

    Legacy apps are those which do not request AMX (or subsequent feature)
    access.The signal stack ABI continues to be uncompacted XSTATE for both
    legacy and new apps.

    Existing code to find offsets in XSTATE still work.
    Existing code doing XRSTOR/XSAVE on signal stack buffer will still
    work.*

    * XSTATE size calculation using CPUID will include
    AMX and other supported features, even if the process did not invoke
    the new system call.    However, the kernel will not XSAVE AMX or later
    features onto the signal stack of a legacy process.**

   ** User-space XSAVE/XRSTOR should size buffers according to CPUID
   if they include the bits of xgetbv(XCR0) in RFBM, because XSAVE will
   write data (including zeros for INIT state) for all features included in
   RFBM.

8. New opt-in apps must agree to provide large enough sigaltstack

    1. must invoke permission system call before touching AMX TMM
    2. must guarantee if using sigaltstack(2), that they have
       allocated signal stack of sufficient size, e.g., by utilizing
       glibc signal.h 2.34 or later.

    (glibc 2.34 changed MINSIGSTKSZ and SIGSTKSZ from 2KB/8KB constants
    into run-time routines. [8])

    Linux will continue to XSAVE/XRSTOR directly to/from the signal stack,
    and the stack will always include the 8KB *space* for AMX TMM and
    subsequent features.

    Linux has an optimization in for all XFD-supported features in the INIT
    state so that XSAVE will skip writing zeros.

9. intel_idle for SPR will clear AMX TMM state

    This guarantees that AMX use will not prevent the CPU from entering the
    idle C6 state, which can be beneficial for power savings, and thus
    turbo frequency.
