> * Used atomic_t for ucounts reference counting. Also added counter overflow

> v5:
> * Split the first commit into two commits: change ucounts.count type to atomic_long_t
>   and add ucounts to cred. These commits were merged by mistake during the rebase.
> * The __get_ucounts() renamed to alloc_ucounts().
> * The cred.ucounts update has been moved from commit_creds() as it did not allow
>   to handle errors.
> * Added error handling of set_cred_ucounts().
>
> v4:
> * Reverted the type change of ucounts.count to refcount_t.
> * Fixed typo in the kernel/cred.c
>
> v3:
> * Added get_ucounts() function to increase the reference count. The existing
>   get_counts() function renamed to __get_ucounts().
> * The type of ucounts.count changed from atomic_t to refcount_t.
> * Dropped 'const' from set_cred_ucounts() arguments.
> * Fixed a bug with freeing the cred structure after calling cred_alloc_blank().
> * Commit messages have been updated.
> * Added selftest.

> v2:
> * RLIMIT_MEMLOCK, RLIMIT_SIGPENDING and RLIMIT_MSGQUEUE are migrated to ucounts.
> * Added ucounts for pair uid and user namespace into cred.

Overall this looks good, and it is a very good sign that the automatic
testing bots have not found anything.  I found a few little nits.
But thing are looking very good.
