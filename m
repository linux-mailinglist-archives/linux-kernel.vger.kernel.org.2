If this does not apply to drm-intel-gt-next (or drm-tip), applying it to
some other branch will just cause unnecessary conflicts later on. It's
unnecessary extra work. It's not an urgent fix or anything, there is no
reason to do that. So that's a NAK.

drm-tip is up to date, it's just that one of the branches that feed to
it is (was?) not feeding to linux-next.

If you're contributing to drm, please consider basing your patches on
top of drm-tip.
