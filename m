This makes sense, but I'll note this behavior has changed over time.

The same is true for the 5.4 kernel.

I do agree that it *should* force a panic, and the fact that
superblock is read-only shouldn't make a difference as to how
errors=panic is handled.

So I think the patch is correct, but I'll note that it also changes
this case:

1)  mount -o /dev/sda -o ro,errors=panic test
2)  echo test > /sys/fs/ext4/sda/trigger_fs_error

With this patch, this will also now panic, whereas before, an
ext4_error() would not trigger a panic.  I think that's better because
it makes things more consistent --- but it is a change in behavior
which could potentially surprise some people.  But since they can
easily get the previous behavior with an explicit "mount -o
ro,errors=continue", I think that's acceptable.

I'll apply the patch with a modified commit description to warn of
this particular change in behavior.
