Intel-pt has a wrapped head, which is why it has the intel_pt_find_snapshot()
function in perf to try to not save any zeros from the buffer that haven't
been written yet. (With a wrapped head pointer it's impossible to tell).

Coresight has a monotonically increasing head pointer so it is possible to
tell. Recently, Leo removed the Coresight version of find_snapshot() for this
reason.

It would be nice to do the same for SPE because that function has a heuristic
and is also slow, but I imagine that not returning wrapped head pointers could
break anything that expects them.
