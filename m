It is writer fair in a sense that once a writer attempts to acquire the
lock no new reader are allowed in.
What you want is that the writer pi-boosts each reader which is what is
not done (multi reader boost). Long ago there was an attempt to make
this happen (I think with rwsem) but it turned out to be problematic.
There was a workaround by only allowing one reader and doing PI as
usual.
This was then dropped because multi-reader became a must have thing for
other reasons and in the meantime the lack of pi-boosting wasn't that
*problematic* anymore. The problematic user converted in the meantime to
RCU having the reading side lockless and the writer had a regular lock.
