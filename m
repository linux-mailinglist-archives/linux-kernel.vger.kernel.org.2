I see that for most of the regulators, these specifications are specific 
to regulator buck (like HFS515) but not chipset specific, we set the 
chipset specific(like pm8009/pm8350c) requirements from DT files.

For example:
pmic5_nldo regulator spec mentions LLIMIT= 0.32V and ULIMIT =1.304V with 
step 8mV

.voltage_range = REGULATOR_LINEAR_RANGE(320000, 0, 123, 8000),
max output voltage supported by this regulator is 123*8000 + 320000 = 
1304000mV which is same as mentioned in the regulator spec.

 From the HFS515 spec I got below info
"HFS510 and lower max output voltage is limited to 2.04V max, and 
Yoda(pm8009) requirement was 2.4V for IOT PA and 2.85V for camera 
application.  Hence, HFS515 added a new register and corresponding HW 
changes to support the higher voltage.  Table 5‑24 shows the new 
FB_RANGE bit.  When configured to 0 the buck works as earlier where Vout 
max = 2.04V in 8mV steps, but when configured to 1 the buck range 
doubles and can now support a Vout max = 4.08V in 16mV steps."

As per above, the max output voltage supported by HFS515 buck is 4.08V 
(which is kodiak pm8350c pmic's requirement).
So, we have modified the buck data to support pm8350c(palani) along with 
pm8009(yoda).
