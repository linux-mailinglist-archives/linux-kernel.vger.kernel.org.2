Oh, no, that would actually also fix the "No data" part, as op->show
will then also return w/o printing in the next iteration, so that op->next
would correctly end it all.

This could also explain why it might all have worked fine on x86 (haven't
verified), and really only showed on big-endian s390.

Hmm, now I'm not so sure anymore if we really want the additional
checks and return NULL in op->start, just to make it "double safe".
