I am allocating this memory directly via alloc_contig_range(start, end,
MIGRATE_MOVABLE, GFP_KERNEL), just looping over 1024MB via 2MB
increments. This is just a synthetic benchmark though we do have an
allocator that behaves just like that as well.

Yes, I did modify the alloc_contig_range() caller to pass GFP_KERNEL |
__GFP_NORETRY. I did run for a more iterations (1000) and the results
are not very conclusive as with __GFP_NORETRY the allocation time per
allocation was not significantly better, in fact it was slightly worse
by 100us than without.

My x86 VM with 1GB of DRAM including 512MB being in ZONE_MOVABLE does
shows identical numbers for both 4.9 and 5.4 so this must be something
specific to ARM64 and/or the code we added to create a ZONE_MOVABLE on
that architecture since movablecore does not appear to have any effect
unlike x86.
