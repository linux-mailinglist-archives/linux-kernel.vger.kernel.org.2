I was holding on applying this patch as I reviewed this partially when I was
on vacation and couldn't remember the comment I had until I just replied now
with applied message ðŸ˜„.

Anyways, is this dynamic_shmem tested on a hardware ?
shmem_* apis are based on __iomem and IIUC tee_shm_alloc_kernel_buf returns
normal memory, so you can't use those shmem_* apis as is. Please drop the
whole dynamic_shmem and send me a patch for v5.17 as we may need more changes
to support that.

I remember Broadcom or someone else wanted this with normal memory, we can
add that support correctly at once involving them too. For now, please drop
that or I can post a patch to do that if you agree with my arguments.

Sorry for completely forgetting about this.
