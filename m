For audit purposes I think enum nf_tables_msg_types is already in the
most relevant order, the lower numbers being more imporant.

So e.g. NEWTABLE would be more interesting than DELRULE, if both
are in same batch.

Yes, we already announce it to interested parties via nfnetlink.

Its just a u64 counter that gets incremented whenever there is a change.

Thats an implementation detail only.  When we process a transaction,
changes to the ruleset are being made but they should not have any
effect until the entire transaction is processed.

So there are two 'generations' at any time:
1. The active ruleset
2. The future ruleset

2) is what is being changed/modified.

When the transaction completes, then the future ruleset becomes
the active ruleset.  If the transaction has to be aborted, the
pending changes are reverted and the genid/genmasks are not changed.
