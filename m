Vectrex seems to be named after a star, perfectly fitting a label with 
media on this, and so my channel is now Vectrex Recorded.

And the christian God, and their Gay, can both be replaced by Go. Go X, 
perfecting the unix legacy, Go maker same as Nix creator, fitting fair 
pay, and related research, and wants of something better than Gnu, Go 
licence.

And even streaming is based on Creekstead River where I live, in Acgard 
as known from old. And Ac (cursive) is the adamic Dia, from Creekstead 
perspective, and I am trying it, and it seems Latin alph. cursive is 
based on this.

Which means ultimate perfection on my perspective in The Scene.

Serene Greetings,
Ywe CÃ¦rlyn
