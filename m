As mentioned earlier, this is changing the sysclk, too. And I'd guess
most codecs need a fixed factor for the sysclk, thus if the codec 
supports
generating its own sysclk by a PLL it will need this factor, too.

Which is also defined in the binding:

   system-clock-frequency:
     description: |
       If a clock is specified and a multiplication factor is given with
       mclk-fs, the clock will be set to the calculated mclk frequency
       when the stream starts.

exactly. and also need a device tree change (also for older kernels)
on my side.

This could be a last resort, yes. But I'd rather see a flag which
indicates whether the simple-audio-card should control the (first)
clock of the codec or not. Because until now, this wasn't the case.
And I don't know if this was an oversight or on purpose. Kuninori would
need to comment on that. And with the "we change mclk by default", we
break codecs with automatic sysclk generation.

Sounds like a hack to me. Esp. its doing the same as its already
doing right now. That is a "sysfreq = clk_get_rate(codec)".

mclk-fs is also a factor for the sysclk, thus it is also needed
if there is no mclk (or a fixed mclk).

I don't think you can deduce whether you can change the codecs
first clock with the current information :(

Yeah, I've just noticed that the clk_get_rate() also only works
for the first clock of the codec.
