So what is the path forward. It seems like you are saying
that the self-describing files do not fit in the fpga-mgr.
Can we reconsider the FPGA Image Load Framework, which does
not make any assumptions about the contents of the image
files?

It would use 2. All of our image update files are self-describing.
