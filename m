I'm not fond of the data_race macro, but I like bogus KCSAN reports
even less.  My main complaint is if we're going to have to put the
data_race() macro in place, we're going to need to annotate each
location with an explanation of why it's there (suppress a KCSAN false
positive), and why's it's safe.  If it's only one or two places, it'll
probably be fine.  If it's dozens, then I would say that KCSAN is
becoming a net negative in terms of making the Linux kernel code
maintainable.
