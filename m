This is a very tight race condition - I agree with you that it is next to
impossible to test.

I think the real fix for this problem should be in the platform driver where
the remoteproc interrupt would be masked while suspending and re-enabled again
when resuming.  The runtime PM API would work just fine for that...  But doing
so wouldn't guarantee that other drivers, i.e IPA, would be operational.  Unless
of one is a child of the other or using a bus like mechanic, and getting
to that point will introduce a lot more churn than what this patch does. 

The proposed solution will work since user space is expected to resume when
the kernel and drivers are fully operational.  As you pointed out the only
concern is with other users, which may not be noticeable given the very small
delay that is introduced.  As such:

But be mindful the patch will have to be reverted if someone complains, whether
that happens in two weeks or 10 months.

Thanks,
Mathieu
